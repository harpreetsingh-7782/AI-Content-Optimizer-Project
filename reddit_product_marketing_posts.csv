I know this isn't breaking news - we've been memeing about it for years, ADHD rates are through the roof, everyone knows this stuff. But after traveling these past few months? I'm genuinely worried now..



When i go into supermarkets it feels more and more like walking into a zombie movie. Cashiers just staring at their phones, blank faces, won't even look up. No smile, no acknowledgment, just silence except for those annoying AI voices and fake laughs from whatever Reel they're watching.



Same deal at malls - shop workers literally ignoring real customers standing right in front of them because they're too busy scrolling.



But today? Today was different



So I'm in this taxi, and I swear I'm not making this up - the driver's got TWO phones going. One playing Reels (with headphones in!), the other one running Google Maps. Literally can't see the road properly, can't hear anything around him. Just completely checked out from reality.



Here's what really messed me up though - it wasn't even about MY safety at that point. This guy genuinely did not care if HE died. Like zero self-preservation instinct.



Should I have said something right away? Yeah probably. But honestly I was too curious about how long he'd actually last like this. He wasn't going super fast so I figured I'd see what happens (dumb decision in hindsight).



Want to guess how long it took before things went sideways?



**Three. Minutes.**



That's it. Wrong exit, slams on the brakes, cars behind us screeching to avoid crashing into each other. Couldn't even properly talk about it afterward because neither of us spoke the other's language well enough.



Self-driving cars will help with the accident thing obviously (that's huge), but they're not gonna cure the actual addiction problem right? So like... how do we actually deal with this?



I'm not pointing fingers here - I'm, guilty too. 

Instagram Reels and YouTube Shorts used to eat up 2-3 hours of my day easy. Tried those app blocker things, they did basically nothing for me.



You know what actually worked though? Deleting the apps completely and only using them through my browser on my Mac. Sounds stupid but that's literally all it took. Can't do that thumb-swipe thing so the addiction just... disappeared.



What worries me about where we're headed - everyone's saying AI search and smart glasses will get us off our phones more. But then other people say nah, having screens strapped to your face 24/7 is gonna make everything worse.



Like are we really gonna be watching Reels on smart glasses while talking to actual people? Walking into traffic while scrolling? Uff, I hope not but.. history says otherwise.



What do you guys think?  
 Will new tech like AI-powered smart glasses actually help us be less distracted from phones, or are we just setting ourselves up for an even worse version of this whole mess?",Futurology,gpturbo,1490,0.93,268,2025-10-21 17:51:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/Futurology/comments/1ocbg0b/how_do_we_fix_the_digital_drug_problem_named/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:futurology

This illustrates a trend with renewables that other energy sources can't compete with. Technology keeps dramatically improving renewables all the time.

Reddit,1of6vcs,Looking for feedback on my app idea: Nexus (group travel made easy for students),https://www.reddit.com/r/Innovation/comments/1of6vcs/looking_for_feedback_on_my_app_idea_nexus_group/,"Hey everyone,

I’m a student founder working on an app idea called **Nexus**, and I’d love some honest feedback from this community before I take it further.

**The problem:**  
Planning group trips with friends in college is *way* harder than it should be. Between deciding on activities, splitting costs, and keeping everyone on the same page, the process usually turns into a messy group chat full of half-baked plans and screenshots.

**The idea:**  
Nexus makes group travel effortless. The app lets college students *swipe* through local attractions, restaurants, and activities (kind of like Tinder, but for trip ideas). Users swipe through different attractions such as hotels, activities and restraunts for a specific location they would like to visit. Then they have the option to invite friends (collaborators) onto the trip to adjust it, change activities, allocate pricing, and ultimately book the trip.

**Who it’s for:**  
Primarily college students and young adults who want to explore new cities or plan weekend trips with friends without endless coordination.

**My goal right now:**  
I’ve built a basic mockup to show how it would look and function, but before I move into full development, I’d love to validate the idea.

👉 **Would you personally use an app like this?**  
👉 **What’s the biggest pain point you face when planning trips with friends?**  
👉 **Any features you think would make this more valuable or fun?**

Any feedback — positive, critical, or skeptical — would mean a lot. I’m trying to make something that *actually* solves a real pain point.

Thanks! 🙌

I’m planning to pursue patent filing in the near future, but as many of you know, the process in India typically costs around ₹10,000–₹15,000 per patent.

To make the process more accessible, I’m considering forming a small group of 5–7 like-minded individuals who can collectively cover the patent filing cost, while I take full responsibility for managing the entire process.

At this stage, this is just an interest check — no specific idea has been finalized yet.

Here’s the proposed structure:

Each participant contributes an equal portion of the filing cost (around ₹2,000–₹3,000 each).

I will not be contributing financially, as I will be handling all the work — including research, drafting, documentation, coordination, and filing.

All contributors will be officially listed as co-applicants in the patent application.

If the patent is commercialized, licensed, or generates any financial returns, every co-applicant — including myself — will receive an equal share of the benefits.

Everything will be conducted transparently, and all details will be agreed upon collectively before any filing or payment.


This initiative is meant for those who want to be part of innovation and patent ownership but may not have the time or expertise to handle the patenting process themselves.

If this sounds interesting, please comment below or DM me. Once I see enough interest, I’ll set up a group discussion to go over details and possible directions for collaboration.

Using a learning rate schedule with warmup, or clipping gradients can reduce the loss spikes or reduce their impact on training.

However, I realised that I don't really understand why there are loss spikes in the first place. Is it due to the input data distribution? To what extent can we reduce the amplitude of these spikes?

Continuous normalising flows push a source distribution to a target distribution via a diffeomorphism (usually an automorphism of d-dimensional Euclidean space). I'm confused about sparsely sampled parts of the data distribution and whether the fact that the diffeomorphic mapping is assuming things about the data distribution (e.g. its connectivity) that aren't actually true (is it modelling the distribution too coarsely or is it learning the true distribution?).

E.g. let's say the data distribution has a lot of pictures of dogs and a lot of pictures of cats but no pictures of ""half dogs-half cats"" because they don't actually exist (note that there may be pictures of dogs that looks like cats but would sit in the cat picture part of the distribution -- dogcats do not exist in the real world). But the region in between the peaks of this bimodal distribution should be zero. But when we perform a diffeomorphic mapping from the source p (e.g., a Gaussian) part of the probability mass must be pushed to the intermediate part of the distribution. This is problematic because then we sample our q (by sampling p and pushing through the learned flow) we might end up with a picture of a halfdog-halfcat but that isn't physically possible.

What is going wrong here?

1. Is the assumption that our map is a diffeomorphism too restrictive, e.g., for topologically disconnected data distributions?

OR

2. Is the model faithfully learning what the intermediate regions of the data distribution look like? That seems magical because we haven't given it any data and in the example I've given it's impossible. Rather the diffeomorphic assumption gives us an intermediate part of the distribution that might be wrong because the true target distribution is topologically disconnected.

It seems of paramount importance that we know a priori about the topological structure of the data distribution -- no?

If you know any sources discussing this, that would be very helpful!

Many thanks!

Interpolating between different objects in latent space produces geometrically impossible results.

Take ""wooden chair"" to ""metal beam"". The interpolated mesh has vertices that simultaneously satisfy chair curvature constraints and beam linearity constraints. Mathematically the topology is sound but physically it's nonsense.

This suggests something wrong with how these models represent 3D space. We're applying continuous diffusion processes designed for pixel grids to discrete geometric structures with hard constraints.

Is this because 3D training data lacks intermediate geometric forms? Or is forcing geometric objects through continuous latent mappings fundamentally flawed? The chair-to-beam path should arguably have zero probability mass in real space.

Testing with batch generations of 50+ models consistently reproduces this. Same interpolation paths yield same impossible geometry patterns.

3. **What topic should I focus on next ?** This one is purely for me to improve even more thanks to you guys.

For the past couple of weeks I have been playing around with PI0.5 and training it on behavior 1k tasks. I performed a full fine-tuning training run of PI0.5 for 30000 steps with batch size of 32 and it took 30 hours.

In order for me to train over 1 epoch of the entire behavior 1k dataset with batch size of 32 I need to perform 3.7 million training steps. This will take around 3700 hours or 154 days which would amount to $8843 ($2.39 for 1 H100).

Reddit,1odccyz,[R] Attention-Driven Transformers for forecasting (better accuracy + speed with less attention),https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1odccyz/r_attentiondriven_transformers_for_forecasting/,"Hi everyone. I'd like to share something I've been working on: Attention-Driven Transformers for time series forecasting

The approach focuses on maximizing attention's representational capacity by using a single top-layer attention block O(n²) to drive multiple lightweight projection blocks O(n), rather than repeating full attention across all blocks. It uses PatchTST's patching algorithm to segment time series into overlapping windows.

The core insight is that attention works best as a global organizational mechanism, not necessarily something you need implemented in every block. The model also uses multiplicative positional encoding rather than additive, which scales features by learned positional weights.

The architecture consistently improves performance over PatchTST (a SOTA baseline) across standard benchmarks while being 1.3-1.5x faster, with improvements ranging from 1-20% depending on the dataset.

Reddit,1od0fw8,[R] rBridge: Predicting LLM Reasoning Performance with Small Proxy Models (100× Compute Reduction),https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od0fw8/r_rbridge_predicting_llm_reasoning_performance/,"We present rBridge, a method that enables small proxy models (≤1B parameters) to effectively predict large-model reasoning performance, addressing the emergence problem in reasoning capabilities.

**Paper:** [https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013](https://www.arxiv.org/abs/2509.21013)

**Abstract/TL;DR:** Given the prohibitive cost of pre-training large language models, leveraging smaller proxy models to optimize datasets before scaling up is essential. However, reasoning capabilities exhibit emergent behavior only at larger scales (typically >7B parameters), making traditional proxy approaches ineffective. rBridge solves this by aligning evaluation with both (1) the pre-training objective and (2) the target task through weighted negative log-likelihood using frontier model reasoning traces.

**Key Contributions:**

1. **Theoretical insight:** We identify that proxy evaluation schemes must align with both pre-training objectives and target tasks for effective reasoning prediction
2. **Novel method:** rBridge weights NLL by task-alignment using frontier model confidence scores, handling tokenizer mismatches at letter-level
3. **Empirical validation:**
   * 100.2× compute reduction for dataset ranking (80.8% decision accuracy across 25 datasets)
   * Strong proxy-target correlations: R² = 0.826-0.874 across 6 benchmarks (GSM8K, MATH500, ARC-C, MMLU Pro, CQA, HumanEval)
   * Zero-shot transfer of fitted functions across pre-training datasets

**Experimental Setup:**

* Proxy scales: 100M to 1B
* Target scales: 7B to 32B
* Training corpus: 250B to 3.75T tokens
* Evaluation: 5-fold cross-validation

**Practical Impact:** This enables compute-constrained researchers to explore pre-training design choices at dramatically reduced costs. A single 7B training run can exceed $50K; our method reduces exploration costs by 100×+ while maintaining predictive accuracy.

Very interesting paper I found about how to make LLMS keep themselves in check when it comes to factuality and how to mitigate and reduce hallucinations without the need of human intervention.

I think this framework could contribute and give LLMs huge benefits, especially in fields where high factuality confidence and low (or ideally none) hallucinations are needed.

They show impressive results, like 97% OCR precision even with <10x compression (original vision tokens vs. compressed ones) and \~60% at 20x.  


**My take \[D\]:** The compression of visual tokens in the latent space is not a new thing it is was done in the VLMs previously. I guess back than the compression was not the main focus, in this paper the focus was on 10x compression. And this gave the AI community idea to compress the input context of LLMs by representing it in image and compressing the image in latent space which could be much more dense as compared to text where the structure is constraint by tokens as the lowest compressed form.

But can't we just compress the text tokens by training an autoencoder and using the encoder to generate the latent space lower dimensional embeddings.

Reddit,1od0v4o,[P] Getting purely curiosity driven agents to complete Doom E1M1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MachineLearning/comments/1od0v4o/p_getting_purely_curiosity_driven_agents_to/,"Quick context: I'm training a playable DOOM world model where you can prompt like ""spawn cyberdemon left"" or ""harder"" to change game events in real time. I wanted to take DeepMind's playable Doom world model in [Diffusion Models are Real-Time Game Engiens](https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.14837), and add text conditioning to make game events promptable.

**To train this I need \~100 hours of action-labeled DOOM gameplay data.**

I could have scraped DOOM data from YouTube, or paid contractors, but thought it would be fun to train a curious RL agent that explores the map. I thought this would be a solved problem, since I saw RL papers from 2018 about ""curiosity-driven"" learning.

I couldn't have been more wrong! Training agents to be ""curious"" is far from a solved problem. Here's what I tried and what happened so far:

**1. Implemented the original** [**curiosity-driven exploration**](https://arxiv.org/abs/1705.05363) **paper(Pathak et al., 2018) → hit the Noisy TV Problem**

The Noisy TV Problem is where the agent gets stuck staring at a random process in the game. This is a known problem with defining the curiosity bonus as prediction error, since noise is not learnable. The specific ""Noisy TV"" the agent converges to is getting transfixed by the pistol's muzzle smoke against a high-contrast white background.

**2. Implemented** [Learning Progress Monitoring](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2509.25438v1) **(2025) → agent converged to taking no action.**

The paper defined curiosity bonus as learning progress: difference between past prediction error of next state and current prediction error of next state. Sounds good on paper, but in practice you have to get a lot right to guarantee past prediction error > current prediction error for learnable (non-random) states. I couldn't figure this out, and past and present prediction error became roughly equal during training, causing agent to take no action due to lack of reward.

**3. Implemented OpenAI** [Random Network Distillation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1810.12894) **→ agent learns  but not because of curiosity**

The agent learned, but only because of extrinsic rewards (kills, room discovery, etc), not curiosity bonus rewards. After many iterations, curiosity bonus rewards shrank to zero as well, similar to LPM. The agent acts greedily to kill enemies and discover rooms, with little to no variety in its actions.

More details here in my repo, where all three implementations work out-of-box: [https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/BoredDoomGuy](https://github.com/pythonlearner1025/BoredDoomGuy)

At this point, I reminded myself training a curious RL agent is a side quest, and I have to get back on the main quest. But if you've trained an agent to complete Doom E1M1 purely from curiosity, I'm curious to hear how you did it!

Reddit,1oeiulp,Bug in Rust coreutils rewrite breaks automatic updates in Ubuntu 25.10,https://lwn.net/Articles/1043103/,"[via Canonical:](https://lists.ubuntu.com/archives/ubuntu-security-announce/2025-October/009890.html)

> Some Ubuntu 25.10 systems have been unable to automatically check for available software updates. Affected machines include cloud deployments, container images, Ubuntu Desktop and Ubuntu Server installs.

The issue is caused by a bug in the Rust-based coreutils rewrite ([uutils](https://uutils.github.io)), where `date` ignores the `-r/--reference=file` argument. This is used to print a file's `mtime` rather than display the system's current date/time. While support for the argument was [added to uutils on September 12](https://github.com/uutils/coreutils/issues/8621), the actual uutils version Ubuntu 25.10 shipped with predates this change.

Curiously, the flag was included in uutils' argument parser, but wasn't actually hooked up to any logic, explaining why Ubuntu's update detection logic silently failed rather than erroring out over an invalid flag.",programming,cachemissed,576,0.94,289,2025-10-24 05:13:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1oeiulp/bug_in_rust_coreutils_rewrite_breaks_automatic/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:programming

Reddit,1of2toi,"Ken Thompson's ""Trusting Trust"" compiler backdoor - Now with the actual source code (2023)",https://micahkepe.com/blog/thompson-trojan-horse/,"Ken Thompson's 1984 ""Reflections on Trusting Trust"" is a foundational paper in supply chain security, demonstrating that trusting source code alone isn't enough - you must trust the entire toolchain.

The attack works in three stages:

1. **Self-reproduction**: Create a program that outputs its own source code (a quine)
2. **Compiler learning**: Use the compiler's self-compilation to teach it knowledge that persists only in the binary
3. **Trojan horse deployment**: Inject backdoors that:
   * Insert a password backdoor when compiling `login.c`
   * Re-inject themselves when compiling the compiler
   * Leave no trace in source code after ""training""

In 2023, Thompson finally released the actual code (file: `nih.a`) after Russ Cox asked for it. I wrote a detailed walkthrough with the real implementation annotated line-by-line.

**Why this matters for modern security:**

* Highlights the limits of source code auditing
* Foundation for reproducible builds initiatives (Debian, etc.)
* Relevant to current supply chain attacks (SolarWinds, XZ Utils)
* Shows why diverse double-compiling (DDC) is necessary

The backdoor password was ""codenih"" (NIH = ""not invented here""). Thompson confirmed it was built as a proof-of-concept but never deployed in production.",programming,fizzner,264,0.94,33,2025-10-24 22:16:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/programming/comments/1of2toi/ken_thompsons_trusting_trust_compiler_backdoor/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:programming

First off, a huge thanks to the mods for approving me to post.

I'm a solo founder working on a way to bring AI agents into the real world. My core belief is that if you have an AI that can potentially ""see"" and ""hear"" your life, **privacy can't be an afterthought—it has to be the foundation**.

So, I'm building **CogNode**, a wearable AI assistant designed around ""Privacy-by-Design"":

* **It's 100% functional offline**. The AI (vision/audio) runs on the device.
* It’s not just recording 24/7. It's designed to augment your perception based on a ""purpose"" you set (like remembering details, tracking habits, or logging food).
* It only shares data if you explicitly tell it to (e.g., to your phone or a cloud service).

I just got the landing page up and running: [https://www.aurintex.com](https://www.aurintex.com)

Since this is the community for this stuff, I'd genuinely love your feedback. Is this ""privacy-first"" approach the right way to build an ""AI for real life""? What features would you need from a new wearable to even consider it?

Really appreciate any thoughts.

Cheers, u/Aurintex",wearables,aurintex,5,0.78,15,2025-10-25 20:15:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wearables/comments/1oftc2g/im_building_a_privacybydesign_ai_wearable_thats/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:wearables

I searched up why this happens but most of the answers says that it's due to I wear them too tight, or it's due to not cleaning them often. I did clean them up and wear them not tight but yet, I still get rashes at times. Just yesterday, it looks worse. My hand is having this swollen look (photo 3 and 4) and it does seems like it has something to do with the lights/sensors.

A few things the article gets wrong, like the cars were leased, not sold. And owners begged to be able to buy their cars.

But the BIG omission was selling the NiMH patent to Chevron.

The decision to do so, which then allowed them to attempt to sue other manufacturers of large format NiMH batteries(eg. Panasonic, who made the EV-95 modules for the RAV4 EV) in order to get them off the market, was a decision that single-handedly held back mass adoption of EVs by at least a decade.

AND if we're talking about GM screwups, NUMMI has to be included

[https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/nummi-2015](https://www.thisamericanlife.org/561/nummi-2015)

>A car plant in Fremont California that might have saved the U.S. car industry. In 1984, General Motors and Toyota opened NUMMI as a joint venture. Toyota showed GM the secrets of its production system: How it made cars of much higher quality and much lower cost than GM achieved. Frank Langfitt explains why GM didn't learn the lessons—until it was too late.

The other three cars were a Kicks for its first oil change (and maybe a sound insulation clip fell off, I've seen that with Nissan/Mitsubishi before), a Mitsubishi Outlander with a windshield chip, and a Chevy Malibu with a driver's seat mechanism issue. That's it.

I started work here with a pretty neutral opinion of Jeep overall and at least a slightly positive impression for the off-road ability of Wranglers. But they're so bad at everything else, and the brand overall is truly bottom-barrel reliability.

The Century brand will stand apart ""in a class of its own"".

Toyota’s Chief Branding Officer, Simon Humphries, suggested the change will enable Lexus to “move more freely.” He went on to say that Lexus can now “push forward as a pioneer,” while Century can concentrate on luxury.

Toyota claims the change enables Lexus to “take on even bolder challenges,” such as reimagining the LS as a six-wheel premium minivan. While LS originally stood for “luxury sedan,” it’s now being envisioned as also meaning “luxury space,"" according to *Akio Toyoda himself*.

While Lexus has spent years chasing BMW and Mercedes, Toyoda stated that “We want to go beyond imitation to improvement, and innovation. I think it’s time for some of our vehicles to push into the realm of innovation.”

Reddit,1odbdor,Service advisors,https://www.reddit.com/r/automotive/comments/1odbdor/service_advisors/,"Hello all. 12 year career technician here, wanting to discuss service advisors and the etiquette they have (or should have) with techs in the back of the shop. I currently work in an independent shop in nowhere Montana, the shop is busy, actually makes a pretty good turn around and all employees are paid well, love working here. Recently our service advisor that had been with the shop for years had a stroke (non fatal) causing him to not be able to return to work. Bossman hired desperately and I believe his choice was poor.

Over the years I’ve worked with a lot of advisors, but this one rubs me wrong in a very different way than I have experienced before, his first 2 weeks cost me and the other two techs a lot. We normally average 12-15 flagged hours in a day. In his first two weeks we averaged 4-6 per day. And I think I know why. In my mind, the advisor lives behind the desk, but this particular guy used to be a “tech” and he likes to butt his head into our jobs during the day, trying to help, give “advice” or just generally try to bullshit while we work, naturally since his skills as an advisor don’t make us techs many hours, we are pretty sore with him so small talk is awkward at best. While he’s in the shop he misses phone calls, leaves customers waiting in the office until they go passed the “no customers beyond this point” sign on the door to try to get someone’s attention, usually me because my bay is closest to the office so I have to stop what I’m doing to get him back to the front to do his job.

Today was kind of my last straw. I’ve been doing this for a long time, I’m good at what I do. I walked into my bay to a bottle of silicone on my toolbox. As soon as I got settled the advisor walks up to me and says “I highly recommend you use this along with the gasket on that timing cover, that way we know it won’t leak again.” Taking every bit of patience I have left, I politely agreed with him and threw the bottle in my bottom drawer when he walked away.

What would you all do about an advisor like this? I’m getting to the end of my ability to smile and wave it off. There are plenty more examples of what this guy does that can be discussed below. But generally I’m wondering what you all do when you get an advisor that just doesn’t fit in and you can’t get through to the boss to do anything about it.

Reddit,1odakz8,What non-vegans often don’t realize,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1odakz8/what_nonvegans_often_dont_realize/,"I’ve put together a few points that even skeptics of veganism can’t really deny. The more often I’ve brought them up in conversations, the more shocked I was to see how little people – even well-educated ones – actually knew about these things. Here goes...

**Milk:** Cows only produce milk after giving birth. They’re artificially inseminated every year, and their calves are taken away shortly after birth – a process proven to cause severe stress for both mother and calf. Male calves often end up as veal or are exported abroad.

**Eggs:** Only hens lay eggs – male chicks are killed right after hatching. Even in Germany, where “in-ovo sexing” is used, the system remains the same: laying hens are slaughtered after 1–2 years, though they could live 8–10. And many chicks are still shipped abroad to be gassed or shredded there.

**Age at slaughter:**

* Chickens: \~6 weeks (natural lifespan 8–10 years)
* Pigs: \~6 months (natural lifespan \~15 years)
* Cows: \~1.5 years (natural lifespan \~20 years) Almost all farmed animals are still children when they’re killed.

**Intelligence & emotion:**

* Pigs recognize themselves in mirrors.
* Chickens remember over 100 faces and have complex social structures.
* Cows grieve and visibly show joy when reunited.

**Feeling:** Neuroscience is clear – they experience joy, fear, and pain just like dogs or cats.

**“Organic” changes little:** Calves are still taken away, male chicks still killed, animals still slaughtered. “More space” doesn’t mean “no suffering.”",vegan,Derderbere2,573,0.93,182,2025-10-22 20:27:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/vegan/comments/1odakz8/what_nonvegans_often_dont_realize/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:vegan

We went to the pet store. I saw some hamsters, gerbils, geckos, and other small creatures.

I saw some small mouses hopping and scurrying around a terrarium. I liked their tails and their grabby little hands. I used my money that I earned from a summer job to adopt two mouses, a terrarium, tubing, and other things to make them happy.

On the first day, the mice were terrified of me. But they quickly learned to associate me with lettuce, nuts, and other things. After a few weeks, they learned to recognize my voice. I let them run around in a hamster ball to explore their environment.

Eventually, I could handle them. I wasn't a very good trainer, so I was never able to teach them to do any tricks. However, they were charming little creatures to have around. They have little personalities and rituals. They liked to sleep in my hoodie pocket.

Unfortunately, they were very short-lived. The passed after 2 years. I never adopted any more mouses.

Years later, I stumbled across a news article about animal rights activists protesting the use animals in some medical lab. The article contained photos of a white mouse restrained in a medical contraption. It looked exactly like the little mouses I used to keep in my bedroom.

It really fucked with me. All I could think about was how violent I would get if someone ever did that my pet mice. If I had the means, I would be right there protesting the medical lab too.

I never set out with the intention of becoming a vegan. I just saw with my own eyes what we do to sensitive, sentient, feeling, thinking little creatures.

I’ve been vegan since I was a teenager, and I don’t think he will ever choose to become vegan.

He is very supportive though and we often eat at vegan restaurants and he very rarely has anything bad to say about the vegan meals I cook at home. 

I have a couple separate skillets, cutting board, bowls, tupperware that are vegan only. He limits his meat to one drawer in the fridge and one section of the freezer.

I am grateful he is willing to do this much for me, but it’s still hard for me to see animal carcasses in the freezer when I’m grabbing frozen berries to make a smoothie. 

We had been talking a bit about my feelings about it, and he asked me “if there was a button you could press that would make me become a vegan, like I’m the same person and the only difference is I’m now vegan, would you press it?” and I said that I would.

He cried. I felt really bad, but is that really such an awful thing to say? It doesn’t mean I don’t love him how he is. I just really wish he cared about veganism like how I do. He said that it sucks that I would prefer a version of himself that is vegan over the version of himself that he is.

There really is nothing bad about the relationship and I love him so much but I do struggle with him eating meat. I feel guilty for feeling this way too. Like I’m silly for being sad about it. 

I’m not ALWAYS crying about it (there have been a few times) and a lot of the time not much thought goes into it. But other times I feel like everything in my kitchen is disgusting and like my partner doesn’t give a shit about animals or the planet… 

I had mentioned one time how I don’t think someone can fully claim to love animals if they eat meat and he disagreed but didn’t want to talk about it.

I don’t know. 

Anyone else dealing or have dealt with this? Any advice or perspectives?

I know this could maybe be better suited for a relationship advice subreddit but I’m really looking for thoughts and anecdotes from fellow vegans 

thank you 💚

And have noticed the significant improvements to my health both physically and mentally.  

I'm here to vent a little.  Last night I had a mushroom trip and had a dark but beautiful vision about how most of the horrible things humanity is going through - war, the muzzling of freedom of speech, billionaires obsession with control - are a reflection or consequence of the mass imprisonment, torture and slaughter of animals.

I saw my body as a sacred temple and that whenever I put animal flesh or ultra-processed food in, it desecrates that temple and throws the energy into the same fear and misery as the animals.

I shared this vision on r/psilocybinmushrooms thinking that people who've experienced the wonder of mushrooms would be pretty chill.  

But the pushback really stung.  I got only hate.  Even a moderator said ""trolling and low quality posts are not welcome here."" What the actual fuck?  I was baring my soul, a pure vision I witnessed in 24k.

I think I need to spend more time with the vegan community and refine how I approach animal advocacy.  To restore my faith in humanity.

People think they're compassionate and kind but when confronted with what they're doing to animals, even gently and non-judgmentally, they go full demon mode.

That’s according to a groundbreaking study from the University of Michigan and the University of Minnesota, published in *Nature Climate Change.* The study traced the [greenhouse gas emissions](https://vegnews.com/climate-content-animal-agriculture) behind beef, pork, and chicken all the way from farm to city.

The researchers created what they call a “carbon hoofprint” for more than 3,500 US cities, revealing how much pollution is tied to each region’s meat supply chains.

I started taking college classes again and just about every week I'm running into one or two new young vegans! Last week I saw someone with an animal rights sticker and said hey, turns out they were in my class.

This week I found out a lab mate was vegan for three years along with their twin brother. It was so cool! 

I'm not 100% on this one but at the gym I saw a guy in a Morissey shirt talking to someone else about making an vegan event? I wanted to but in to confirm but it felt too awkward.

Maybe some vegan brands are dying a bit because the based youngun's without money are carrying the torch.

So here’s all I know about this agreement:

**Masimo ($MASI)** was accused of **misleading investors about its ability to sustain growth and accurately project revenue** following its **$1 billion acquisition of Sound United**. The lawsuit, filed in the **Southern District of California (Case No. 3:23-cv-01546)**, alleged that the company and its executives **failed to disclose material information** about declining sensor sales, delayed orders, and overestimated demand.

On **July 17, 2023**, Masimo reported **preliminary Q2 2023 results** showing significantly lower-than-expected revenue, explaining that “large orders anticipated for the second quarter were delayed” and that “single-patient use sensor sales were down due to elevated inventory levels at some customers.” Following this disclosure, **$MASI fell about 20%**, wiping out shareholder value.

Earlier in **February 2023**, CEO **Joe Kiani** had called 2022 “a momentous year” and claimed the company’s healthcare segment “outperformed expectations,” providing upbeat guidance that investors later claimed was misleading.

Now, the company has **agreed to settle $33.75 million** with investors, and the **settlement is in the stipulative stage — pending court approval**.

**Who can claim this settlement?**  
Investors who purchased **Masimo ($MASI)** shares between **May 4, 2022, and August 8, 2023**, may be eligible to receive compensation once the court approves the settlement.

**Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?**  
No, eligibility typically depends on purchasing shares during the affected period — not whether you sold them.

**How much money do I get per share?**  
The estimated payout is around **$1.30 per share**, depending on the total number of valid claims submitted.

**How long does the payout process take?**  
It typically takes **4 to 9 months** after the claim deadline and final court approval for payments to be distributed.

Hope this info helps!",MedTech,EducationalMango1320,1,1.0,0,2025-10-21 16:59:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/MedTech/comments/1ocaes5/masimo_masi_faq_for_getting_payment_on_the_3375m/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:medtech

Reddit,1oe9e3w,Why are suits and “good shoes” such a pain?,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1oe9e3w/why_are_suits_and_good_shoes_such_a_pain/,"Bit of a rant, but also a genuine question to people who actually enjoy dressing well.

I’ve always worked in tech where “business casual” basically means jeans and a clean T-shirt, maybe a blazer if there’s a client in the room. Now I’ve switched to management consulting and even though I’m not client-facing, everyone around me looks sharply dressed. I figured it’s time to level up.

So I’ve started buying proper clothes: suits, shirts, good shoes… and honestly, I’m shocked.

A suit that’s even remotely comfortable seems to cost a fortune. And even then, it’s barely flexible. Getting my kids out of the car or reaching for something above shoulder level feels like I’m about to pop the suit like hulk. The fabrics are delicate too, feels like brushing past a table corner could rip the jacket. And don’t get me started on cleaning. Dry cleaning only?! That’s not just expensive, it’s inconvenient. How do people not smell like an old taxi by the end of the week?

Then there are the shoes. Everyone says, “A good pair will last a lifetime.” Sure, but after what feels like months of blistering pain and bleeding heels. You can’t wear them two days in a row, you’re meant to polish them after each use, and the decent ones cost a small fortune.

So here are my actual questions:
	•	How do you clean and maintain your suits? Do you just avoid cleaning them altogether?
	•	How many pairs of “good” shoes do you actually own and rotate?
	•	Do you genuinely follow all the maintenance rituals Reddit recommends?
	•	And finally, how much have you spent in total on your work wardrobe?

Because right now, I’m wondering if everyone is secretly as uncomfortable and broke as I feel.

However, since the last winter, they’ve not been able to carried out MTO service and they will focus on the basic products. The leather options for most of their RTW shoes have also reduced to black and dark brown, with the lack of sole options.

So, how does everyone think about the brand’s current situation? Is it still a good choice for classical menswear beginners who want some entry level dress shoes with very high value? How would their products probably change in the future?

I'm looking for brands that looks like ""Country Heritage"" (I think, please correct me if I'm wrong) to work into my wardrobe. 

  
Think: Dinner after a pheasant hunt at an estate.   
What I'm wearing now and the style I like: Barbour, Chevalier, Filson, Fjällräven (some).  
I want items that I can wear to the office but still preserve the feeling ""outdoors"", ""countryside"" and ""hunting"".

I despite the bright, neon coloured outdoor stuff.

Links to pictures of the style I'm looking for:

I understand designer brands are often looked down upon by the traditionalists; however, outside of the cost/value, and “better to go bespoke” analysis: are their collections something individuals in this community appreciate? Do their silhouettes, fabrics, and other aspects provide value to a men’s wardrobe that leans towards everyday business-casual? Any personal opinions/experiences?

Thank you.

P.S. I am aware that these brands are quite different, but unfortunately my favs - therefore, the question surrounding such opposites (though I’d argue also quite similar to an extent).",malefashionadvice,Zealousideal_Pause38,16,0.78,62,2025-10-23 11:52:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1odvwl7/thoughtsconsensus_on_brands_like_cucinelli_and/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:malefashionadvice

Reddit,1oceade,How does “Christmas cocktail” attire in the American South compare to other regions?,https://www.reddit.com/r/malefashionadvice/comments/1oceade/how_does_christmas_cocktail_attire_in_the/,"Curious about regional takes on “Christmas cocktail” dress codes for men, especially in the American South. I know Southern cocktail attire can lean more traditional or even a bit more festive (velvet/tartan/burgundy, etc.)

If someone normally wears more classic/relaxed fits and doesn’t own traditional dress clothes, would a specifically Southern holiday cocktail event typically call for:
Full suit?
Sport coat + trousers?
Tie / bow tie / no tie?

Would love to hear what people actually see guys wearing at these events in the South, and how “festive” usually translates in reality.

Curious to hear thoughts on regional differences!


ETA: Yes, I am fully aware that “Christmas cocktail” is not an established, universally recognized dress code 😂 I didn’t coin it, the hosts did, but Reddit wouldn’t let me post a straightforward “what would you wear wear / outfit examples / interpretations” question due to the rule bot. Above is my creative (read: “ineffective”) attempt at re-phrasing to get around that. Hence… whatever this post became lol.
If you’ve never heard of “Christmas cocktail,” same. I’m guessing it just means normal cocktail attire but with festive colors or holiday touches? But feel free to confirm or roast that interpretation 

I’d still love actual outfit examples or how you would approach a Southern cocktail party with a holiday vibe.

Reddit,1of1fpj,How do you shop effectively?,https://www.reddit.com/r/femalefashionadvice/comments/1of1fpj/how_do_you_shop_effectively/,"I feel like I'm in a constant internal battle between:

1. I can't shop without trying the clothes on, from now on I'm only buying clothes in person.
2. In person stores are all polyester low quality shit now, from now on I'm only buying from specialty stores online.

And as you can see those are opposite goals so no matter what I do, it's a waste. The things I buy online don't fit right and it's a hassle to return, or they're way overpriced for what they are and trying to be ""luxury"" for no reason. The clothes at the mall are mainly cheap junk that falls apart after a few washes. I guess the best thing would be to find an online brand I know the sizing of and consistently love the clothes of, or an in person store that sells high quality clothes. These are surprisingly extremely hard things to achieve, especially without sinking a CRAZY amount of time, energy, and money into it.

So how do you guys shop? Do you stick with certain brands? Do you only buy clothes you stumble upon that check all the boxes? I'm also happy to receive specific brand recommendations if you know any that are high quality, mainly natural fibers, and not ridiculously overpriced. But I'm mainly looking for tips/perspective in general, as this seems to be an issue plaguing society at the moment.

But nowadays, it feels almost impossible to find a bag, a pair of shoes, or even clothes that can be your companion for at least five or six years; everything is made to be temporary. (90% of my wardrobe is thrifted/secondhand clothing bc it lasts longer.)

Whether it’s shopping online or in stores, it’s all the same cycle. People buy things to fit into the aesthetic (to match an outfit for the night) to perform a sense of taste. But I don’t think that’s what tasteful really means.

This isn’t just about personal preference anymore. We’re taught to value novelty over longevity, trends over timelessness. (I hate trends) Products are designed to fall apart or fall out of fashion, just so the cycle of consumption keeps spinning. 

I don't think we are aging gracefully.

Reddit,1oef44q,Help me end the continuous horror of wearing uncomfortable underwear,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainableFashion/comments/1oef44q/help_me_end_the_continuous_horror_of_wearing/,"Hello good people. I hate almost all of my underwear. Help please!  
  
I replaced my falling-apart GAP and Victoria's Secret underwear with Aerie Superchills (not sustainable, I know), which I thought were great for about the first two washes. I still have some of the old falling apart ones, but they're not really in functional condition anymore, so I'm mostly stuck with the Aerie ones. Why ""stuck?"" They crawl up my ass after about three steps. I'll be at work and I have to check my surroundings and yank em out multiple times per hour, or just suck it up and waddle. I'm trapped with rags or wedgies. HOWEVER - there was one pair of underwear above all underwear: the Allbirds Anytime Briefs. 

A few years back when I got my first full-time job, I bought a few Allbirds thongs and one, singular, glorious pair of these briefs. Now that all of my other undies that didn't floss my buttcrack are too worn, I was ready to bite the bullet and buy some more. At like $16 a pop, this would have been a big purchase, and even though I make less money now than I did when I first bought these (adjusted for inflation), I was just ready to end this sensory nightmare. Alas, they're discontinued, and I can't find any unopened resale in my size (S). 

Y'all. I'm so bummed they don't sell these anymore. Any recommendations for similar products? They were lightweight, didn't crawl up my ass, and had very thin seams (unlike ARQ, which I love the look of, but I have one set and the seams and elastic are SO THICK that they show under even loose fitting pants and also have very small leg holes). 

Thank you :)

TLDR; anyone know women's bikini- or brief-style underwear that is similar to the Allbirds Anytime Briefs of olde?",SustainableFashion,deargussie,18,0.95,53,2025-10-24 02:32:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainableFashion/comments/1oef44q/help_me_end_the_continuous_horror_of_wearing/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:sustainablefashion

Reddit,1oeptq4,The Thrift and Resale Market in the US is Growing,https://www.reddit.com/r/SustainableFashion/comments/1oeptq4/the_thrift_and_resale_market_in_the_us_is_growing/,"Thrifting has really become part of mainstream fashion now, and I think that says a lot about how people are rethinking consumption. According to a [Capital One Shopping study](https://capitaloneshopping.com/research/thrifting-statistics/), **1 in 5 Americans** thrift every year, and about **30%** say they do it mainly for sustainability reasons.

Other interesting stats:

* The U.S. second-hand apparel market is already **worth over $50 billion** (and expected to hit $74 billion by 2029).
* Saving money is the top driver for thrift shoppers: **88%** of U.S. second-hand consumers say they choose used goods for the savings.
* About **one-third** of clothing and apparel items purchased in the U.S. over the past year were secondhand.

It feels like thrifting has gone from being just a budget-friendly option to something that reflects a shift in values — a way to shop more intentionally and reduce waste.

\-What if all these items , thousands of them, could tell their stories?

\-Where they’ve been, what memories they hold?

Every day I’d see things moving: sold, shipped, forgotten. Perfectly good clothes disappearing into a system built only for transactions, not meaning. I think we need more continuity.

I was looking into how even just 100% cotton is made with lots of pesticides & chemicals during the manufacturing process. I made a lil chart of common pesticides used & how they affect our bodies. 

|Chemical|Type|Toxic Effects on Body|
|:-|:-|:-|
|Aldicarb|Carbamate pesticide|Extremely toxic. Interferes with the nervous system by inhibiting acetylcholinesterase (AChE). Symptoms: sweating, muscle twitching, nausea, blurred vision, respiratory failure. Even small doses can be fatal.|
|Chlorpyrifos|Organophosphate|Disrupts AChE like Aldicarb. Linked to developmental delays, reduced IQ, and behavioral problems in children. Acute effects: headache, dizziness, paralysis, breathing difficulty.|
|Dimethoate|Organophosphate|AChE inhibitor affecting the central and peripheral nervous systems. Causes nausea, vomiting, abdominal pain, muscle weakness & confusion. High doses can cause convulsions & coma.|
|Endosulfan|Organochlorine|Acts as a neurotoxin by disrupting ion channels in nerves. Associated with seizures, liver/kidney damage, reproductive harm, and endocrine disruption. Persistent in the environment and bioaccumulates.|
|Methamidophos|Organophosphate|Potent AChE inhibitor. Acute exposure can cause chest tightness, muscle twitching, vomiting, blurred vision, and death from respiratory failure. Chronic exposure linked to neurological and reproductive issues.|

3 Brands I would recommend are Recovery Brand clothing (hyperlocal!), West Path, & Organic signatures.

Reddit,1oc1mc3,My 12+ year old Casio Watch is a force to be reckoned with,https://i.redd.it/ermalc2opdwf1.jpeg,"This is my Casio Pro-Trek PWR2500

I was gifted this watch way back when, and has outlived every other watch I’ve ever had. This thing is a beast and has been all over the world from desolate deserts to the Atlantic and Pacific oceans. Here is every reason this watch will outlive me.

1. I have never charged it. This watch is 100% solar powered. There isn’t even a way to plug it in to the wall or change the battery. Thus, I could be in the middle of the Mojave for years and it would always work. It’s apocalypse proof.

2. The time is always as accurate as my phone. I have never set the time either, only the time zone. This is because it actually checks its internal time frequently through the radio signal from Fort Collins’ Atomic Clock.

3. It’s free. Unlike an Apple watch or Garmin, it only does a few things really well. Minimalist. Plus, It’s not stealing my data to show me ads either.

4. This thing is made of steel. I could think of countless situations I’ve been in where a normal watch would crumble. Submersion, smashing, dropping, scratching. Sure, the casing is a little worn. But for some reason, the screen has not one scratch on it. Every function still works perfectly!

5. It’s just really cool. It has a ton meteorological instruments on it such as a compass, barometer, moon phase, and the *tide*. It’s also a world clock. It might be a divers watch? I’m actually not sure who the target demographic is.

If I could bring anything to a desert island, it would probably be a lighter, a knife, and this watch!

Question: Does anyone actually know the lifespan of something like this? And if so, what part is the achilles heel?

Reddit,1oc25db,This vintage sewing machine helped me detach from fast fashion,https://i.redd.it/oryx8pm9sdwf1.jpeg,"I saw a post from a couple of weeks back talking about detaching from fast fashion, and I thought some people might appreciate this, especially if they're trying to get away from the trend of disposable clothing (which is so much of what's available these days). AND it lets me show off my beloved post-war German-made 216G on a treadle, whom I've named Gertie (her name being derived from her brand and my sewing idol) and her essential buttonhole accessory. 

About 5 years ago, I decided I'd stop buying clothes and start sewing my own wardrobe in earnest. And this was the machine that made it possible. Detaching from fast fashion has absolutely positively impacted how I perceive my own body, and it's allowed me to actually be *more* stylish than I had been because I was being very deliberate with adding to my wardrobe (a new garment is going to be an investment on multiple fronts, after all). I'm personally trying to build a wardrobe that embodies the BIFL mentality. (I have garments I've purchased, loved, and regularly worn for nearly 20 years now, so for the way I wear my clothing, it's not impossible.) I certainly don't think you need to sew to have a stylish wardrobe with longevity (though it helps to know how to mend). 

So here's her specs: Gertie is all-metal, motorless Singer 216G mounted on a treadle table, meaning her current ""motor"" will last precisely as long as I do. I acquired her second-hand for $100 and she was in fantastic condition when she came to me.  I've sewn for hundreds of hours on this machine, making coats, dresses, suits, skirts, trousers, jeans, pajamas, stretchy T-shirts, and gowns for myself and my family. Basically everything except under underwear (bra making is pretty scary).  
  
When I was shopping for a vintage sewing machine, I wanted one that was truly BIFL (hence the treadle), and my wishlist included some features that most motorless vintage sewing machines available these days didn't have, namely a reverse function, a buttonhole function, and a zig-zag stitch. (By the time the engineering was there for those functions, electricity was widely adopted, meaning sewing machines were predominantly motorized.)

As an aside: I got all three technically (the zig-zag means I can make my own buttonholes on the machine) but TBH, the vintage Singer Buttonholer accessory that's made for those old straight-stitch only machines makes the best buttonholes really fast and easily (they're even better than modern machines with computerized buttonholes, especially through heavy fabrics. I can't sing its praises enough!",BuyItForLife,thatterigirl,269,0.96,27,2025-10-21 08:45:36,https://www.reddit.com/r/BuyItForLife/comments/1oc25db/this_vintage_sewing_machine_helped_me_detach_from/,False,False,False,,subreddit_top:BuyItForLife

So I spent a lot of time searching for high durability jeans. And I found this little-known brand in France called ""Bollid'ster"". They make cloths for bikers with a fabric that is extremely resistant, and the pants had a 10 year warranty. I'm not a biker but 10 years of warranty got me on board. 

So I got their 'middle resistant' one, called ""Bolid'ster R"". And the cut/style is very classic you wouldn't know it's a biker's jean. It's as comfortable as any other jean out there.

I've been wearing it for 4-5 years, every day (save summer days when I switch to shorts). And it has not moved. Not one bit. No holes, no tear, nothing.

Reddit,1odips2,Update: Reigning Champ Buyer Beware,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odips2,"After some strong recommendations here for Reigning Champ as a BIFL hoodie, I purchased a Midweight Terry hoodie for $128USD. 

This is my third fall season with the hoodie. Last year the hood stitch started coming undone. This year I noticed a hole in the elbow and the cuffs had started wearing through. 

I contacted their customer support and they told me this was considered normal wear and tear. I asked what they considered to be the normal lifespan of their hoodies and the rep on the phone said she expected it to be roughly 5 years. 

In the third photo attached, I included my $12 Walmart-bought Hanes hoodie that I used to wear to high school wrestling practice (15 years ago) to show a comparison of the wear on the elbows. I bought that Hanes sweatshirt to be torn up and beat up rolling around on the wrestling mat and it held up great. With how expensive this hoodie was, I wear it around the house and wear it out casually, but it’s not a “knock around” clothing item by any means. 

After speaking to the rep on the phone, she did inform me that they were acquired four years ago and that their manufacturing processes had changed (outsourced to Vietnam) and that they had noticed a drop in durability. The kicker here is that my hoodie is “Handcrafted in Canada” according to the tag. 

I was at least hoping to have the hoodie repaired by reigning champ, but I guess I’ll see if I can fashion up a patch and maybe re-hem the sleeves to at least keep this hoodie wearable for another few years. 

I’m incredibly disappointed in the quality of Reigning Champ. I’m disappointed that their warranty department was unwilling to help with repairs. I’m disappointed that I wasted so much money on the price premium of AA supposedly “BIFL” product.

I am usually the type to fix my devices when they need a new battery or when something goes wrong, but in my most recent attempt, the glue holding my phone together was so strong that my screen delaminated just trying to get the thing open to replace the battery. To add insult to injury, the new battery didn't even significantly improve my battery life because Apple's OS for older phones seems to be so bloated that the phone is constantly just running at high processor utilization.   
  
I currently have an iPhone 12 mini that is hanging on by a thread. The camera no longer focuses and make a weird squeaking sound when activated and my screen (being a third party replacement) frequently malfunctions. 

This is where I get to my headline question: ""How do you guys go about phones?"". It seems that if I am going to be buying one of these devices every 5 years or so, the only way I can take back control is to withhold the amount I spend on said device. 

I have been looking at the Samsung Galaxy A26 recently and it appealed to me because it has expandable storage and Samsung lists it as having 7 years of security/software updates. The only thing is that this phone is supposedly a significant step backwards in processing performance from the benchmarks I see online. I am a Medium-Light user mostly using my devices to consume video content as I get work done. 

Is there anyone in this sub that frequently uses budget tier phones, can give advice on this and provide confirmation that this is the way to go?

I ordered 4 Hollow Knight records on the eve of the release of the 2nd part in order to choose the best option for myself and give the rest to my friends for the new year. They sent this - all the records have the strongest corner jams, the packaging was just a box without anything. I contacted support and they replied that it was not their problem, but the delivery (although it was their problem for the goods to reach me in one piece!). they offered compensation of 10 dollars for the fee, which is ridiculous! I said that I either needed a replacement, or I was ready to make the same order with a discount - I explained that I was a collector and the condition was important to me. Besides, I was buying a new product at the price of a new one - not b stock. And they told me the following - WE DO NOT SELL VINYL IN COLLECTOR'S CONDITION! In other words, I was told in plain text that we were dealing in non-condiments and garbage, and were unable to ensure the safety of the order during transportation. I have all the expensive collectors.p.s. and then these desks cry that they are being squeezed by a big soulless retail, and they are so unhappy, they work with their hearts. No Fangamer, you don't work with your soul, you don't care about your customers and your service is at the zero level. From now on, I will not buy all your orders from you in other, more adequate places.**

Reddit,1oeibc6,"New product incoming: The ""Bastard"" Tri-Lug. Compatible with 9mm tri-lug adapters, but bored for up to .458 projectiles and threaded for large bore PCCs.",https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1oeibc6,"The Bastard Tri-lug is a muzzle device which accepts standard 9mm tri-lug adapters but is bored for up to .458 caliber projectiles and has threads to allow for direct mounting on those larger caliber PCCs and SMGs without requiring a thread adapter.

This solves many of the problems that come with using the tri-lug system with larger calibers. The .45 caliber tri-lug muzzle devices and adapters currently on the market are not made to a consistent standard between brands, and the overall selection of adapters and muzzle devices is much more sparse.

If you have a 10mm or .45 caliber suppressor and wish to use it on your 9mm firearms also, you can now simply install a 9mm tri-lug adapter of your choice onto the suppressor and use the Bastard Tri-Lug on your larger caliber firearms along side any 9mm tri-lug muzzle devices on your 9mm firearms. No more thread adapters or compatibility headaches!

Reddit,1oe95o8,Chess is a Mess,https://i.redd.it/npphuhax9wwf1.jpeg,"

Spoilers… not that it matters.

I don’t know if this is an official term, but I’m a bit of a Chess-Nut. I listened to the original concept album obsessively when it came out in 1984 (and pretty much ever since), saw the West End production in 1987, the Broadway version in 1988, and even had a cat named “Chess” — though my mom, I think, called him “Chesstopher.” My sisters can fact-check me on that.

So, to say I walked into this new production with great excitement is putting it lightly. Even with early word that the show had problems, I was eager to hear that incredible music again. And with Lea Michele, Aaron Tveit, and Nicholas Christopher in the cast, I figured at least it would sound great.
Wrong.

A little history for context: Chess began as a concept album written by Benny Andersson and Björn Ulvaeus (of ABBA fame) — a format Andrew Lloyd Webber and Tim Rice had already used successfully for Jesus Christ Superstar and Evita. The idea is that you write all the songs, sketch a loose story, record it, and then, if it’s successful, turn it into a full show. Chess was a huge hit — “One Night in Bangkok” was everywhere — and so the London production moved forward.

Chess was born during the height of 1980s West End spectacle — when Phantom of the Opera had its falling chandelier, Miss Saigon had its helicopter, and Cats had, well, all those cats. The era was all about theatrical excess, and Chess was no different. The music demands a big show to match.

I don’t recall much of that original London production except the stage — a massive rotating chessboard on a hydraulic arm. It twirled, lifted, and at times lit up like an actual chessboard or turned pure white to resemble a mountaintop. I also remember the cast throwing out foam chess frisbees during “Opening Ceremony” — oh how I wish I’d caught one. The show followed the concept album closely: mostly sung-through, with very little dialogue.

Then came America. The Broadway version was completely reconceived and, frankly, a disappointment (it lasted only two months). One of the major changes was to rewrite the book and add tons of dialogue in an effort to make it more dramatic.

Which brings us to this current incarnation — where it seems the creators decided to take the American version and make it even more talky and less theatrical. Instead of focusing on the emotional core — the love triangle between the brash American, the Russian, and the woman caught between them — this one fixates on the political machinations that were once just background texture.

Now, Molokov (the KGB agent) and de Courcey (the CIA agent) are front and center, while our three supposed leads are pushed to the side. Even the Arbiter has been turned into a main character — a sort of Emcee-from-Cabaret figure who narrates and comments on everything.

This is a very sparse production. The stage has staircases on the left and right and an elevated section in the back for the orchestra (see the photo I took). Center stage is ringed with couches and… that’s basically it. A bed rises from the floor at one point, but that’s the only “set.” The costumes are all black suits and dresses, with minimal changes and no real set transformations (unless moving a couch counts). There’s a light grid that lowers at the end of Act II for no discernible reason — though it did provide a little tension as I wondered whether someone might trip over it.

Story-wise, the new book (as proudly advertised on the poster) by Danny Strong treats the audience like first graders. The Arbiter is now the narrator, breaking the fourth wall constantly — “Welcome to our Cold War musical!” — and tossing in modern political jokes (including one about RFK Jr.’s brain worm). Personally, I hate this kind of storytelling. It’s all telling, not showing. The narrator is constantly explaining how the characters feel, and then we watch them act out exactly what we were just told. It reminded me of those “Story of Star Wars” records I had as a kid, where they condensed the movie into an hour by cutting in dialogue and music while a narrator filled in what you couldn’t see. This show felt exactly like that. With nothing visually interesting happening on stage, I could’ve closed my eyes and not missed much — and honestly, given how boring it was, that was tempting.

Because the actors aren’t really playing through a cohesive story — just scattered scenes — there’s little chemistry between anyone. It doesn’t help that director Michael Mayer’s main direction seems to have been, “look stiffer.” The emotional climax, “You and I,” is especially painful: Lea Michele and Nicholas Christopher sort of wander toward each other, then hug awkwardly. It felt like a high school production. This is followed by Lea breaking down in tears when she learns her father is alive (sorry for the spoiler), which is thankfully interrupted by a joke from de Courcey. I know Lea Michele is a capable actress, but none of this felt believable. I once again place the blame on the director. It’s clear that comedy is the only emotion that interests him — and I’ll admit, the audience I saw it with seemed to embrace all the jokes that came at the expense of the story.

Subtlety is also not one of Michael Mayer’s strengths. When Anatoly sings about being a pawn of the Russians, he’s literally bathed in light beams shaped like prison bars. Get it? He’s imprisoned!

With the story and staging being a disaster, surely the music can carry this show — but even that is mangled. I couldn’t see the whole stage (the sightlines in this production are narrow, but you’re really not missing anything), so I couldn’t count all the musicians, but I think there were 18. Which is just not enough for this score. It was also hard to hear some of the lyrics (and I know this score!). More frustratingly, the original score has been changed. Lyrics have shifted, songs have been reassigned to new characters, some have been dropped, and two have been added. In addition, some songs are shoehorned in for no reason — especially “Someone Else’s Story,” which doesn’t really belong at all, particularly after the 11 o’clock number “I Know Him So Well.”

The choreography — when it exists — looks like a cross between Elaine’s dancing from Seinfeld and the stadium wave (yes, the wave — twice), performed by the 16-member chorus. All in matching suits, they’re ever-present — sometimes as a Greek chorus, sometimes just sitting around on couches watching. It’s so frustrating because I get that a player has 16 pieces in a chess game — yet there’s no attempt to use the ensemble in any symbolic way. Such a missed opportunity.

Speaking of chess, the two times a game is played in the show, it’s done in the dullest manner possible. Two microphones come out, and our characters stand next to each other and speak their moves.
“Pawn to E4. Rook to C4.”
No visuals. Just them saying it. Didn’t anyone in this production watch The Queen’s Gambit? There are better ways to stage a chess game!

I suppose I should talk about a few of the highlights. Act II loosens up a bit — “One Night in Bangkok” has the chorus disrobing (women in lingerie, men shirtless) while, in a fun reversal, Freddy Trumper starts in his underwear and gets dressed during the number. Another bright spot: Hannah Cruz as Svetlana. She shows up, brings real energy, and actually acts. For a moment, I thought she might be an understudy who didn’t go to many rehearsals, because she was the only one showing emotion.

By the end, I felt nothing. Emotionally, the show is a void — though I did learn more about the SALT II treaty and the 1983 NATO exercise “Able Archer 83,” so there’s that.

Walking home, I put on the original album and let my brain scrub away the memory of this dreary production, replacing it with the brilliance of the music I fell in love with decades ago.",Broadway,Japes2000,913,0.94,402,2025-10-23 22:45:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/Broadway/comments/1oe95o8/chess_is_a_mess/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""new product""'"

They're addressing the backlog caused by the outage and working to ensure new items will begin appearing in your queue soon.  ***The team has informed me that they expect to have the issue fully resolved within the next 48-72 hours, at which point you should start seeing new products appearing at their regular frequency again.***  I appreciate your patience and understanding during this technical disruption. As a valued Vine member, your continued participation is important to us, and we're working diligently to restore the program to its normal operations.

Reddit,1oevf2g,The time my company canceled an entire product launch because the engineer lied.,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oevf2g/the_time_my_company_canceled_an_entire_product/,"This was almost a decade ago, I was in the marketing team for a big tech company in China. We had just spent months putting together a promotion plan for a big upcoming product launch.

The weird thing is, throughout the whole process, R&D just wouldn't give us a working prototype. They'll provide mockup, renders, spec sheets etc but the product manager would always find some excuse when we ask to see a product demo.

I was set to fly out for the TVC shoot the next morning and we need the prototypes that night. So R&D told us to come by around 8pm. Around 9 pm they finally bring out one unit, which promptly shuts down due to overheating.

What followed was a clown show as every unit they had either would bug out or shuts down. We ended up waiting until almost midnight as they frantically tried to fix the problem. Finally they just gave up.

The result was that we had to cancel the entire planned shoot. We also had contracted multiple KOLs to create contents for the launch and that had to be scrapped as well. The cancellation cost the company close to $300k USD.

It wasn't until later that I learned what really happened: the product manager on this project has been lying to the company for almost an entire year. This was his first time being in charge of a product launch and he frankly didn't know what he was doing. The overheating issue was previously pointed out by more senior engineers but he ignored their warning. During the weekly progress meetings he would bring only mockup unit to hide his progress. Somehow he got away with it up until the point where he couldn't hide it anymore.

I heard that instead of firing him, the company sent him off to ""The Farm"" instead. This was an R&D facility in the countryside in the middle of nowhere. It's basically exile until you can't take it anymore and quit.

As for the product, they ended up completely rethinking the design and the subsequent launch was a huge success.",stories,SatisfactionTall1572,198,0.92,16,2025-10-24 17:10:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/stories/comments/1oevf2g/the_time_my_company_canceled_an_entire_product/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""product launch""'"

Reddit,1oesl2o,How indie hacker can nail there first product launch?,https://www.reddit.com/r/SideProject/comments/1oesl2o/how_indie_hacker_can_nail_there_first_product/,"The biggest mistake I see founders make is waiting until everything is polished. Your MVP just needs to solve one problem really well. You can add features later based on what users actually ask for. Perfection kills momentum.

Start building your audience before launch day. Like at least a month out. Share what you're building on Twitter or wherever your users hang out. Join relevant subreddits and Discord servers but actually contribute value first. Don't just show up to promote. When you eventually launch those relationships matter more than any ad budget.

Your landing page needs three things. A demo video under 90 seconds showing what your product does. A clear problem statement that your audience relates to. And screenshots or testimonials if you have them. Lead with the pain point not your features. People need to know you understand their struggle before they care about your solution.

For launch day pick two or three platforms max where your actual users spend time. Developers hang out on Hacker News. Productivity tools do well on Twitter and Indie Hackers. Don't spread yourself thin trying to be everywhere. Launch Tuesday through Thursday for best visibility and avoid Fridays.

The real key is engagement. Respond to every comment and question. Thank people for feedback even critical stuff. Your responses often matter more than your upvote count. Founders who actually care about their community stand out.

Post launch is where most people mess up. They disappear and wonder why momentum dies. Keep sharing updates. Email your early users and ask what confused them or what they loved. That feedback is gold.

Product Hunt isn't the only option anymore. Check out platforms like [prolaun.ch](http://prolaun.ch) that let you build an actual presence over time instead of just a one day spike. Because honestly people care about the builders not just the products.

Launch with something imperfect. Learn from it. Keep iterating.

Reddit,1oewl2r,Best practice for choosing colours on new product launch,https://www.reddit.com/r/ecommerce/comments/1oewl2r/best_practice_for_choosing_colours_on_new_product/,"Hello!

I’m placing my first bulk order and would like to hear your best practices on minimising risk with colour orders (fabric product).

I’ve asked my supplier for their list of most frequently re-stocked colours from their big clients in my market.

Their list reflects my research in colours most often advertised, and colours in the best sellers of my competitors. 

However, what I’ve noticed is the top competitors in the market offer a richer colour variation than those my supplier recommended, and a lot of mid to lower quality versions of this product are sold at a cheaper price, in very similar shades my supplier recommended.

So, my theory is, by offering a varying shade to most common on the market, customers could justify a price increase over low-quality options. But this theory doesn’t match with the data my supplier gave me, so I’m unsure of how to proceed.

No. 1 is safest colour, but very plain, not sure if I’ll run ads on it

No. 2 and No. 3 will run ads on, and have colour variations that while the supplier didn’t recommend, are closer to what the top competitors are doing, colour wise.

So, what is your advised % split of colours in my first order, including any additions of riskier colours

I was thinking to split my order, and test the colour variations:

No. 1 25%

No. 2 25%

No. 3 25%

Richer variation of No. 2 12.50%

Richer variation of No. 3 12.50%

Or is this too risky? I want to minimise as much risk as possible.

Would really appreciate your thoughts!

Reddit,1og752w,Hardins Creek Product Launch and Review,https://www.reddit.com/r/whiskey/comments/1og752w/hardins_creek_product_launch_and_review/,"I was a huge fan of the Boston, Clermont, and Frankfort Hardins Creek so I was super excited to hear about another release this year and decided to go to the distillery for the launch (although it was out many places earlier).

 **The Launch Review:**

 It was interesting to hear the details of the Hardins Creek line and this edition.  Such as the bottles being originally slated for another product, and the bottles meant for Hardins Creek were delayed.  Listening to Freddie Noe, it seems like they’re not entirely sure what they want the Hardins Creek line to be, but I wouldn’t be surprised to see another release of 3 bourbons from the other sites in the next years, or something entirely new.  There are also lots of details/easter eggs in the labels, which I guess might appeal to some?

 Overall, I’d recommend the launch because you get some behind the scene details and it’s a great way to ensure you can purchase harder to find releases (not sure what that would be from Jim Beam?).  Also of note, the gift shop had pretty much all allocated Beam products already released out which is always nice to see.  I'd rate the launch **8/10** for the price ($30).

 **Hardins Creek Review:**

I think my experience is similar to what’s already been posted with a few deviations so I’ll keep it brief here.  All three in my experience share similar mouthfeel/finish (which tbh shouldn’t be “too” surprising because it’s a micro-climate experiment vs last year’s release).

**The Mushroom:**

No windows, lowest floor, and I get a light bit of oak, tobacco, and vanilla.  It’s the easiest sipper out of the group and I think would have the broadest appeal.

 **The Beaver:**

In the middle, surrounded by wood, and to me this feels like a classic jim beam release.  Strong oak, but not too forward.

 **The Owl:**

The highest floor and only 9 floor rickhouse they have.  Very strong oak flavors, with some tobacco, vanilla. 

**The Verdict:**

Overall I’d rate these release **7/10.**   Why the same score?  Because although there are variations, they’re all of equal quality and to me they’re equally good (in different ways).  However, the move to 700ml is not a good trend and the $150 price is a little high for what you get compared to other offerings.  Still, they are worth picking up if you want to try something a little different.  If you're not a huge Beam fan, then mushroom or owl is where I'd go.

It’s a product film, but we tried to make it more than that as for us this is not just a backpack but a visual story about freedom, connection, and creativity beyond boundaries.  
We filmed in different environments - cities, forests, off-grid spots to show what “working anywhere” really looks like.

Yostar messed up, big time. One of the gacha darlings expected to release came out and it flopped harder than a chocolate soufflè.   
Let's get to business with the usual rubric:

**Rerolling**  
Quite fast, very easy, big ""error margin"" per reroll given the built-in reroll start and the launch rewards (20+ limited pulls I believe.)

**The Gacha and Pulls Income**  
This is bad... Pull currency revenue is about the same as hoyo games, with 5-10 little gems at a time.  
...Issue? The pulls cost 300 and not 150/160. This is a slap in the face after showing in the beta that pulls were 150 each. This is compounded by paid packs not accomodating this price increase, leading to OUTRAGEOUS demands such as 4 dollars per single pull or 50 dollars barely getting you 25 pulls. Or whales doing the math and finding out you need 400dollars to guarantee one character without signature.  
But let's get to that gacha, which also stinks to high heaven. The gacha is 2% with 50/50, guaranteed at 120.   
In order:  
\-There is no pity giving you extra 5\*s if you fail along the way. You just get the character at 120.  
\-If you fail the 50/50, there is no guaranteed next 50/50 is a win. I have lost 4 50/50s in a row.  
\-The rates description is VERY confusing, on one side saying you get the rate-up at 120 and right after saying you have a guaranteed within 160 rolls.  
\-Every 10pulls, you get 1 free single roll on the ""weapon banner""  
Abysmal is not even remotely close to describe this mess. We will talk more about how much you are rewarded when clearing content later.

**Character pool**  
There are currently 8 5\* and 16 4\*. But it might as well be only 8 5\* characters. The divide in damage between the two is SO BIG it makes 4\* absolutely worthless to run as main dps, even when running mono-element. More in the combat section.

**Character building**  
Sigh.... have we learned NOTHING from Ash Echoes complaints??? To build the characters, the game makes you play a """"""roguelike"""""" mode (yes I'm putting it in brackets since so far there are no branching paths you can choose to explore when clearing rooms and it's basically a long forced corridor) and then take a snapshot recording of your build at the end. You then combine this data with your team current level and skill level and go clear every other content. For HSR players, imagine if you had to run Simulated Universe over and over to record clears and then having to use those clears to do any content in the game.  
For the build itself, you have a main dps you control and two support units that you can call to use their skills or ultimates. Every character can pick a variety of Potentials personalised to them like Boons. Think like buffs from HI3 Elysian realms except you also pick buffs for the 2 support units.  
You also get ""records"", aka weapons, that give you substats and a passive to trigger IF you get enough musical notes during your roguelike run. (Think Equations from HSR SU)  
The game does have a relic system but nobody has been able to access it because... well we'll see in the progression section why.  
One last big elephant to address: dupes. For 4\* characters, you need TWO dupes to get 1 Talent level (Eidolon). This is kind of a deaf point since, as I already adressed, 4\* characters are worthless as main dps but still. Players are having lots of problems especially when they would like to max their favorite character. This issue is only linked to 4\* as 5\* give the full amount of fragments needed to fully unlock a talent.

**Progression**  
***RUN***.  
This is, by far, the most awful possible thing ever.   
So, every single system in-game is locked behind Account level. Account levelling is done by doing dailies and spending stamina....  
Remember day1 HSR issues of having content locked behind level and people just not having the stamina to get over that wall? Yeah, this is that but 10 times worse. You get a ""mini"" wall at level 10 to 11  
And then the Dead Sea from 11 to 13-15 (next unlock point). Only people who have bought the battlepass have currently reached level 15. The stamina recharge rate and initial stamina items are ridiculously low, leading to f2ps being sitting ducks for a few days.  
This wouldn't be a problem if players were able to properly level up their characters in the meanwhile....  
...oh boi. The game has boxes to pick and choose ascension materials for character level cap, skill level, record level etc. As soon as you run out of those boxes, you are in no man land.  
Every material quest cost 30 stamina. At difficulty 4 (unlocked at level 11) you get 6 common materials and the chance to drop 1 Rare material. You can trade 3 commons for 1 rare.  
...you need 10 commons... AND 15 RARES to go from level 30 to 40 on a single character. In the worst case (which is very very unlikely), you would need to spend 270 stamina for a single level uncap. You get 1 stamina point every 6 minutes, do the math. In worst case scenario (which again, unlikely), you would need 1620 minutes to get a single low-level uncap... OR TWENTYSEVEN HOURS. Assuming you get a 1 drop every run aka best case, you will still need 7 runs, or 210 stamina, or 1260 minutes or 21 hours.   
This is plainly ridiculous. Yes, the game showers you at the start in material boxes but those are not even enough to clear the required uncapped characters number for the ""beginner"" quests.  
Skill levels go even worse. At difficulty 3, you get 7 common drops and chance at 1 rare drop. Skill costs are 6>12>24>38 for commons and 0>0>3>8 for rare materials. There are 4 skills per character, albeit you will only have to level 3 for a character you use as main dps and 2 for supports. Still, let's assume a main dps. You will need to level up 3 skills till level 4, 126 commons and 9 rares. Just to reach the target common mats needed, you will have to run 18 times. And that's without accounting for Rare drops. So yea... ABSOLUTELY HORRID.  
Also no, the game has no ""converting down"" system.   
Account level-wise, the exp gates needed are also high af  leading to players being stuck in limbo with nothing to do.  
Just... no.

**Combat system**  
The combat is bird-eye view with auto-shooting mechanics. It's basically Vampire Survivors but you also get to activate skills and ultimates.   
Enemies are GIANT Hp-sponges, and healers are basically useless at the current point because even without dodging you are never in danger. AND if you slot in an healer, you are losing SUBSTANTIAL damage on the overall.  
Now, I did want to talk about why 4\*s are useless. As I already said, you only actively control one character as a main dps. The game heavily favors running mono-elemental teams due to how Records passives work. Even then, the damage numbers from 4\*s are abysmal. One of the content, arena, has elemental arenas where you need to run a record with a main dps of a certain element.  
...well. In the water arena, I first tried a mono-water team with all 4\*s. I failed miserably.  
I then made a record with the same dps and 2 5\*s supports (Minova and Mistique for those interested). Well? Would you look at that, I'm suddenly clearing everything. HOWEVER, more funnily enough, the supports are doing 5x the damage of my main 4\* dps.  
This is an issue that's gonna be curved in time with bigger character pools yada yada but the fact the character I, the player, I'm playing is dealing infinitely lower damage than the characters I activate with a button is soul-crushing.

**Content**  
What content??  
Here's the list of content available to level 11 players and their ""rewards"":  
  
\-Main story. Only 2 main chapters currently in game. 360 gems for the first, 480 for the second.  
\-Ascension (roguelike). 3 towers, 3 difficulties. 100 gems per difficulty cleared. You also get 5-10 gems for stuff, like collecting 10-20etc. different Boons for each individual character or unlocking archive notes by running them.  
\-Menace arena. (wave mode/element-check mode). 7 arenas, 6 element ones (2 per day rotate). 5 difficulties for the general one, 3 for the element ones. 200 gems per difficulty. Yes, clearing an entire 10 wave arena doesn't even give you a single pull.  
\-Cataclysm Survivor (Literally Vampire Survivor. Incredible naming Yostar). \*Technically\* All 7 difficulties unlocked but you most likely will only clear the first two at this point. 100 gems per difficulty+ some 5 gems every 15 cards of a certain combat style you collect in a run.  
  
\-Basic trial (level up fodder). 3 difficulties. 50 gems per difficulty.  
\-Tier up trials (level uncap mats). 3 bosses, 4 difficulties. 50 gems per difficulty.  
\-Skill trial (skill materials). 3 bosses, 3 difficulties. 50 gems per difficulty.  
  
And that's about it. The 3 last modes need all 30 stamina to run. There is no launch event, no infinite roguelike mode, nothing. And the content that is there spits in your face with the rewards given, may it be first clear gems or level up materials.  
You do get 100 gems per level and 500gems every-time you clear a quest bundle to guide you through progression (beginner quests), but that's, again, stamina-gated. Heavily.

**Monetization**  
I already said most of the bad in the gacha section but lemme add more!  
The welkin is 5 dollars, 90 gems per day+600 from purchase, leading to 3300 gems vs 3000 gems on hsr/genshin... Problem is over there that's 18.75 pulls, here it's only 11. And if you are wondering, dailies only give 100 gems.  
However the biggest insult has to be the battlepass, Ofc classic stuff like the normal track only gives perma-pulls, if you buy the normal pass you also get to pick one of several battlepass only weapons etc.  
...the issue is the skin. If you pay 7 extra dollars, you get a special pfp and a character skin...  
...well. Turns out it's not a skin but just a wallpaper. You heard me right, the paid skin doesn't change AT ALL the character 3d model. It's only a live2d wallpaper, with the extra insult that when inspecting it in the battlepass buyscreen it has a switch between 3d and 2d toggle and it just shows you the base model. Absolutely insane. Ridiculous.

**Dramas**  
Well, basically all of the above with CN/JP players rioting due to how bad EVERYTHING is but with a few small extras. Mainly, the fact that between beta and release the gacha cost was DOUBLED and rates were altered. Also some CC blatantly being sponsored and having to be very... ""mute"" about the situation and treading carefully. Yostar, on their end, made no comments about any of this despite the loud response. Also JP VAs later having a playthrough livestream to promote the game and everyone knowing it's gonna end horribly chat-side...

**Conclusion**  
Skip. Just don't. Just play more Blue Archive if you want ""that"" stuff. This is a pit of greed, lament, uninspired game mechanics and just... no.  
You want a new game? Go play CZN.   
You want a good game? All glory to Limbus Company.  
Thank you for the read

EDIT:
Just adding some extra stuff.
1. Pity. You get a guaranteed at 120 on a single banner. That one doesn't carry over. After that, there s a guaranteed within 160 rolls that does carry over, I do not know if the 120 guaranteed cancels the 160 pity.
2. Tech incompetence. Mainly, in the game you can invite some of the girls to hangout at dates.... the hangouts are copy pasted, nothing personalised. Also for whatever reason the gacha pull audio is separate from the game app audio and it messes up when muting game window.
3. The livestream. As predicted, it's currently a mess. The chat is full of people both EN and JP demanding changes and moderators constantly deleting, muting and banning chatters.",gachagaming,gugali123,1691,0.93,682,2025-10-21 15:12:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/gachagaming/comments/1oc8k9f/stella_sora_more_like_stella_soar_in_the_dumpster/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""review""'"

**[4News.it](https://opencritic.com/outlet/917/4news-it)** - [Danilo Di Gennaro](https://opencritic.com/critic/10821/danilo-di-gennaro) - *Italian* - [8.9 / 10](https://4news.it/recensione-the-outer-worlds-2-una-nuova-folle-odissea-spaziale/)

>Take The Outer Worlds, improve every aspect that didn't convince the most skeptical at the time, and you'll have the result of Obsidian Entertainment's hard work. The space madness returns in The Outer Worlds 2 with brilliant writing, multifaceted role-playing, and even greater freedom of choice. All this is complemented by a fun combat system and decidedly more contemporary gunplay. The icing on the cake of a year to remember for the Californian team, which once again proves itself to be one of the most successful software houses of this generation. It's a shame that the AI is sometimes too predictable and, ultimately, that they didn't dare to go even further with this formula. With a new chapter of such quality, the prospects for a great franchise are definitely there.

>Outer Worlds 2 has a large number of improvements but it also has some open world bloat in the form of long sprints doing absolutely nothing. Also the writing can feel as if a bit of the charm is gone, where laughing from the outside worked in the original title, in the sequel it almost feels like the laughing is gone, replaced with a smirk at most. Fun shooting though!""

>The Outer Worlds 2 is a deeply engaging RPG shooter that excels in storytelling, character development, and immersive world-building. Its narrative depth, branching choices, and amazing companion system make it a game that can fully captivate anyone willing to invest the time. It improves on the original with better gunplay, larger scope, prettier visuals and meaningful player decisions, offering a rewarding experience that stands on its own merits.
>
>It has some flaws, like the dull open-world environments, an abundance of text that can hamper the pacing and punishing permanent perk choices, but these are minor drawbacks that do little to overshadow the game’s many strengths. 
>
>I think this one is worth your money, and it's a no-brainer if you're a Game Pass subscriber.

>The blank slate of it all perfectly captures the imagination of any player and should be considered as one of the best sci-fi RPGS in recent memory. Even if gamers haven’t played the first game, they need to give The Outer Worlds 2 a shot.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is one of my favorite RPGs released this year, and it's so close to greatness. It has practically everything I wanted in a game (enough that I could have considered it even better than Mass Effect), but Obsidian just missed the mark with its tone. Who knows, maybe the company will figure it out with the third game in the series.

>There are a few ways in which The Outer Worlds 2 doesn’t improve on the first game. It’s bigger, deeper, and more complex. The story and characters are more satisfying. Combat has been refined. It takes its time and demands players be patient and engage in all its systems, and overlook some technical issues that pop up somewhat frequently. I can’t imagine a world — Outer or not — in which fans of the original won’t enjoy this new experience.

>The sequel to this space-based action RPG returns with a much more interesting, straightforward story that doesn't get bogged down in trivialities. It improves on many aspects of the previous game to make The Outer Worlds 2 a well-rounded installment.

**[Console Creatures](https://opencritic.com/outlet/798/console-creatures)** - [Bobby Pashalidis](https://opencritic.com/critic/7698/bobby-pashalidis) - [9 / 10](https://www.consolecreatures.com/the-outer-worlds-2-review/)

>The Outer Worlds 2 is an odd game. It's bigger than its predecessor, more absurd, and fires on all cylinders, but it's also a game developed by a studio now run by a megacorporation. For all its inherent themes, it's bizarre seeing them transposed with the ongoing issues at Microsoft over the last several months. This is a game that is made by some of the best in the business, but you can deliver hit after hit and still face the chopping block. If The Outer Worlds 2 is Obsidian's swan song (which I doubt it is), then know that it's easily the studio's best game since Fallout: New Vegas and one of this year's best video games.

-------------

**[Console-Tribe](https://opencritic.com/outlet/918/console-tribe)** - [Luca Saati](https://opencritic.com/critic/10828/luca-saati) - *Italian* - [85 / 100](https://console-tribe.com/recensioni/the-outer-worlds-2-2-324881/)

>The Outer Worlds 2 delivers a classic more of the same﻿ experience, but in the best possible way: it builds upon the original’s formula and expands it in every aspect, creating a deeper, more engaging RPG. The narrative shines with sharp satire and social critique, supported by an incredibly broad and flexible choice system that ensures high replay value. The player’s ability to shape their character through abilities, flaws, and interactions with a living, dynamic world results in a deeply personalized and never predictable experience. Gameplay strikes a solid balance between dialogue, stealth, and combat, featuring a well-implemented progression and perk system. Technically, this sequel marks a significant leap forward, presenting vibrant, detailed worlds infused with a unique blend of retrofuturism and sci-fi western aesthetics that give it a distinctive visual identity. Some elements fall short, however—particularly the third-person mode, which feels underwhelming and poorly executed, and the enemy AI, which, despite improvements, remains easily exploitable. These issues slightly hold back what would otherwise be a near-flawless experience.

>Which side you serve and how you choose to do it make for a fun, planet-hopping ride, which, when combined with improved gunplay and notable small stories, renders The Outer Worlds 2 a worthwhile RPG adventure.

-------------

**[Dexerto](https://opencritic.com/outlet/863/dexerto)** - [Jessica Filby](https://opencritic.com/critic/9424/jessica-filby) - [3 / 5 ](https://www.dexerto.com/gaming/the-outer-worlds-2-review-a-disappointing-sequel-3271358/)

>After waiting six years for another crack at The Outer Worlds, it feels disappointing to be met with a sequel that is so promising but marred by a poor first half and frustrating Flaws. But the game isn’t a total flop, saved by its whimsical charm, vivid dystopian subject matter, and the classic, slower, and more explorative design that Obsidian games have perfected.

**[Digitale Anime](https://opencritic.com/outlet/944/digitale-anime)** - [Raouf Belhamra](https://opencritic.com/critic/11073/raouf-belhamra) - *Arabic* - [9 / 10](https://ar.digitaleanime.dz/archives/78407)

>""An RPG Masterpiece That Redefines Freedom""
>The Outer Worlds 2 proves that Obsidian remains at the pinnacle of its creative game. The game doesn't reinvent the formula, but it refines it with stunning mastery. With its blend of humor and drama, complex choices, and distinctive graphics, it delivers a complete RPG experience that blends philosophy and fun. An intellectual and aesthetic journey in a corporate-controlled world, it captures the essence of Obsidian games: giving players the freedom to think and act.

**[Digitec Magazine](https://opencritic.com/outlet/887/digitec-magazine)** - [Domagoj Belancic](https://opencritic.com/critic/10266/domagoj-belancic) - *German* - [5 / 5 ](https://www.digitec.ch/de/page/40091)

>""The Outer Worlds 2"" is Obsidian's magnum opus. All the elements that make the studio's role-playing games so unique are implemented better than ever in the second installment of this satirical space epic. The game impresses with its graphically stunning worlds, complex game mechanics, and a great deal of flexibility. Controlling my character feels great, the weapons are wonderfully crazy, and the new gadgets are a useful addition to the already excellent combat system. It's fun to see how the game world and its inhabitants react to my decisions and sometimes even exclude me from important game content.
>The relatively compact playing time is a matter of taste – it didn't bother me. On a technical level, the role-playing game performs amazingly well. The only annoying things are the menus and UI elements, which suffer from some annoying problems and bugs.

>Mission after mission, The Outer Worlds 2 seems to deliver on its ambitions and on the studio’s vision of offering a confident, solid action RPG, with a few genuinely interesting mechanics. And I’ll admit, there’s a lot to like here, but it started to lost me when, for every good or interesting idea, there are two or three others that makes the game look stuck to the past holding Obsidian back from reaching higher.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is an exemplary sequel that showcases Obsidian’s maturity as a studio. Despite some technical issues and a slow start that demands patience, what you get is a deep RPG where every choice carries weight, every faction exists in shades of gray, and the world-building reaches outstanding levels. The Arcadia system is a living universe that begs to be explored again and again, revealing genuine narrative branches with each playthrough. If you’re looking for a game that respects your intelligence and rewards your time investment with one of the richest experiences in the genre, this sequel achieves it brilliantly.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is a fantastic modern RPG. The emphasis on player choice and customization, the great dialogue and characters, exceptional worldbuilding, and fun gameplay mechanics make it one of Obsidian's best games in years. However, that excitement is hindered by frustrating navigation mechanics, constant glitches, and characters that lack depth due to the absence of romances and natural speech options. While this is a great return to form for the genre, you may be better off waiting for all of the issues to be fixed in a post-launch update before buying.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is okay, and perhaps that is its biggest flaw – it is unable to match either its powerful rivals or New Vegas, to which it is merely derivative. In a year packed with excellent games, it's hard to justify buying it when there are so many great, cheaper RPGs out there.

>The Outer Worlds 2 expands on everything that made the first game shine — sharper writing, bigger worlds, and richer choices — all wrapped in Obsidian’s signature corporate satire. It’s funnier, deeper, and far more polished, though the no-respec rule might test your patience. Still, it’s a clever, confident sequel that proves refinement can be just as satisfying as reinvention.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is, essentially, a safe sequel. Obsidian retained everything that made the first game so beloved—bitter humor, narrative freedom, and vibrant setting—but without venturing too far into new ideas. The result is a solid RPG, with sharp writing and a still-captivating universe, but one that may feel too familiar for those expecting something bolder.

>Obsidian’s brilliant use of their flaws system in The Outer Worlds 2 makes it stand out as one of the best examples of how to encourage roleplaying in video games. Playing through this game really felt like I was breaking out of the shell that most other RPGs put me in. The world, its various factions, and characters all enhance this by encouraging you to make your own choices about who to be and what to do. Ultimately, this makes the game well worth your time, but also flawed in its own way, with occasionally frustrating combat, and a serviceable story to follow.

>With The Outer Worlds 2, Obsidian once again delivers a role-playing game full of freedom, wit, and playful depth. In areas such as quest design, dialogue, and the expanded RPG system, it is even among the best the genre currently has to offer. Unfortunately, technical issues, bland—almost forgettable—companions, and a weak final third with an abrupt ending prevent it from matching the greatness and charm of the first The Outer Worlds. What remains is a great, but not perfect, adventure that could have been a true masterpiece with a little more polish.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the first game in every respect, with deep, rich role-playing and plenty of freedom to tailor your experience. Every world feels curated, and exploration is always purposeful and rewarding. Topped off with a vast range of weapons, brilliant writing, and a story and character that's yours to shape, this is Obsidian doing what it does best to deliver an engrossing RPG you'll want to replay again and again.

**[Gaming Boulevard](https://opencritic.com/outlet/414/gaming-boulevard)** - Lander Van der Biest - [8 / 10](https://gamingboulevard.com/2025/10/review-the-outer-worlds-2/)

>Even with its familiar structure, The Outer Worlds 2 is easy to recommend. The combat is tight, the writing cuts, and the player agency still feels substantial. It’s a smarter, smoother, and more technically reliable sequel that doesn’t lose the soul of the original. If you loved the first game, you’ll feel right at home. If you skipped it, this is the perfect place to jump in. Build your misfit, pick your lies, and see who believes you.

>The Outer Worlds 2 feels like another season of a beloved TV series — only this time with a bigger budget. Everything you loved about the first game is here, but many of its problems and flaws have been fixed. If you’ve played Avowed, you can expect something very similar in terms of the game’s technical systems. And if you’re among those who complain about everything Obsidian has made since the days of New Vegas, you’ll probably complain about this too. As for me, I thoroughly enjoyed the game. It delivered exactly what I hoped for, fixed what I criticized in the first installment, and the problematic moments weren’t big enough to spoil the experience. At the same time, if you haven’t played the original, there’s no need to — the story stands on its own, the characters are new, and the setting is entirely fresh, so the game works beautifully even by itself. But if you have played it, your return to this insane, corruption-soaked, corporation-ridden sci-fi world will be every bit as enjoyable as mine.

>The Outer Worlds 2 may not be suitable for all players due to its complex narrative, but it’s undoubtedly a fitting choice for those seeking a deep RPG experience that demands thought and analysis. It offers you the freedom to choose a path that aligns with your own direction, both in terms of story and gameplay. However, it still suffers from several issues that need fixing.

>The Outer Worlds 2 improves upon its predecessor in mission design, combat, and meaningful player choice, offering a solid sci-fi RPG experience.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is a title well worth exploring, offering accessible gameplay and thoughtful quality-of-life enhancements that cater to both newcomers and returning fans. While it doesn’t radically reinvent the formula, it delivers a satisfying action RPG experience that scratches the adventure itch and rewards players who engage with its missions in full.

>The Outer Worlds 2 may not revolutionize what we saw in the first installment, but it significantly improves on familiar elements. If you're in the mood for a great space opera with a satirical twist and RPG elements, you should definitely give this shooter a try.

>The Outer Worlds 2 manages to captivate with its charismatic cast of characters, a world that truly rewards exploration, and a good variety of approaches and choices that generate real consequences in the player's journey.

>The Outer Worlds 2 excels on almost all fronts, presenting you with an open RPG that lets you choose how you progress while still keeping you on a clear path. The in-game systems allow you to customize how you play and give you versatility in the choices you make along the way. Combine that with great writing, and you have a recipe for success. Equipment menus are a bit clunky, enemy encounters can be manipulated, and the act of looting takes some getting used to. Still, none of these issues will keep you from enjoying the game. The Outers Worlds 2 is worth every penny of the $70 it asks for.

>The Outer Worlds 2 succeeds in being a bigger and better sequel, buoyed by an even greater emphasis on player choice and freedom. Its RPG mechanics are largely fantastic, and there are key improvements to both combat and exploration.However, despite Obsidian's clever writing, there's a underlying dreariness to the property that it just can't seem to escape. These dull characters and their one-note factions are difficult to truly care for.

>Despite all of its environmental detail, scope, and promise of a wider, more exciting space-faring adventure, The Outer Worlds 2 is a disappointment. While it offers divergence and choice, its paper-thin satire, tonal mishmash, and balancing oddities see the experience crumble under the weight. In addition, the review build’s far too many immersion-destroying bugs, blocked questlines, and other sequence breaks ensure that the game’s issues outweigh its redeeming qualities.

>The Outer Worlds 2 builds on Obsidian's strengths: an authentic, smaller-scale RPG full of possibilities, with satire and moral decisions. Rather than competing with open-world giants in terms of scope, it emphasises its system, humour, and detail. If you enjoyed the first game or New Vegas, you will get exactly what you would expect from Obsidian here, only in a slightly bigger and prettier package, with a little more depth. It's Obsidian's most extensive RPG in this style yet.

>After years of waiting and some personal skepticism, The Outer Worlds 2 marks Obsidian’s return to the most ironic and cutting-edge space opera in the RPG landscape. The Californian team seems to have listened to every criticism of the first installment, smoothing out long-standing flaws while enhancing writing, freedom, and world-building. Arcadia is a living, reactive, and surprisingly believable system, where every choice—big or small—leaves a tangible mark. And while some technical hiccups and still-too-predictable AI prevent a perfect score, the feeling is that we are facing the best RPG of the year.

>Obsidian Entertainment continues to make better sequels, even to their own games, and The Outer Worlds 2 surpasses the prior game in every way. Obsidian has honed in on the tone, and the anti-capitalist dark humor is much more even, and full of laugh out loud moments. Compelling companions, better combat, and rich quests makes everything feels so reactive and symbiotic to your action, or inaction. Decisions are presented to you around every corner, and with so many branching paths, it encourages experimentation and ensures you’ll replay it. The Outer Worlds 2 is a stellar sci-fi RPG to be an instant classic.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is all that I could’ve ever hoped it would be. Funny, smart, alive. It’s packed with memorable characters, sharp writing, and art direction that’ll stand the test of forever. And just like how Fallout: New Vegas was the better sequel to its predecessor (spare me the pedantry), this feels like a confident step up, even Auntie Cleo would call it character growth.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is bigger and better than the original, but, alas, plays it much safer. Overall is a more solid effort from Obsidian, and has much more content than the first game, but the surprise effect from the 2019 is gone. Still, a solid and very fun RPG from one of the most talented teams around in creating worlds, interactions and dialogues.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is a good game, sometimes even a great one. However, it plays things a little too cautiously for a sequel that once promised to push boundaries. It’s pretty polished, funny and loaded with charm, yet still feels content to orbit familiar territory rather than charting something truly spectacular. A solid recipe for disappointing your fans.

>The Outer Worlds 2 shows that Obsidian won’t be left behind as other great RPGs launch to critical success, and that the developer needs to play to its strengths. I only hope that it learns to take itself more seriously, because the setting is brimming with potential that is yet to be realised.

>The Outer Worlds 2 is a thoroughly enjoyable game, but as sequels go, it's largely more of the same. While the overarching story isn't terribly interesting, the world building around it and the colony of Arcadia is great to explore. What's disappointing is a lack of improvement in too many areas. It looks better and gunplay is better, but old snags and weaknesses from the first game remain and, more importantly, it's not as exciting and new as it was the first time round.

>The Outer Worlds 2 isn’t Obsidian displaying any major advances in game design or unique innovations that would turn heads. This is a game of solid refinement from a studio that believes so deeply in the world they created in 2019. This resulted in a cohesive and entertaining RPG that could very well solidify as one of their best works today.

Reddit,1og8o9j,Traded my RS6 for a brand new RS3 - honest review,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1og8o9j,"To get the “why” out of the way, I did it because we’re buying a house and I wanted to free up some cash flow. Now…

The RS3 is in doubt the most engaging audi or any sports sedan I have had the pleasure to own. I’ve owned the whole lot of S, RS cars including the S3, S5, RS5, RS6. I’ve also owned an f82 M4 and this little pocket rocket is the closest I’ve gotten to feeling that visceral, engaging feeling that makes you just wanna take the back roads home. There’s just something so unique about the sound of the inline 5 that makes you wanna wring it out to the red line. The handling is Superb, the car truly does feel like a go kart. 

I wouldn’t be honest if I didn’t point out some negatives based on my ownership thus far. 
- the car is small, so If you need to carry your whole family, this isn’t it. I take my two girls to school (7 and 10), I’m 5’11” and I have no issues. We use the q7 for long family trips 

- there’s noticeable wind and tire noise at high speeds. I’ve read that the Bridgestone protenza sports can be very loud so I might switch them next summer.

- the quality of the interior is questionable in some spots, although if I’m being truly honest my rs6 had tons of rattles and the dashboard quality was also questionable.

The RS6 is truly a remarkable car which I understand to many is the pinnacle of audi. Here are some observations based on my ownership of the RS6

- Quite possibly the best looking modern audi, estate. Always admired its exterior design. 
- Brutally fast, but really shines on the highways
- Very thirsty. I averaged 18L/100km over my ownership. Got about 300kms per tank. Spent about $400 in gas per month. 
- Very comfortable even on the 22” wheels but cannot win over physics, it did feel quite heavy and big especially around corners.
- Driving aggressively came with some guilt knowing how much fuel it drinks and consumables (tires and brakes) are to replace. The RS3 is a no guilt kinda RS car. 

For the first few days after I switched I had the biggest buyers remorse knowing that I’ve given up on what most would consider a “dream car” but the more I’ve driven the rs3 the more I forget about the rs6.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 offers a thrilling, action-packed experience with a creative arsenal and plenty of visceral combat.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a triumphant return, a successful fusion between Team NINJA’s elegance and PlatinumGames’ trademark spectacle. With its deep combat system, an all-new protagonist, and a world that lives and dies alongside the player, this new chapter manages to honor the legend of Ryu Hayabusa while paving the way for a new generation of ninjas. It’s not just a sequel; it’s a rebirth, a statement on how to reinvent an icon without betraying its soul. At its core, Ninja Gaiden 4 is a true lesson in design and discipline. We’d like to thank Xbox for providing us with a review code for this game.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is more than just a return; it's a rebirth of one of the greatest action franchises.

>PlatinumGames sought to replicate the success of NieR: Automata and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance with Ninja Gaiden 4, and when it comes to the combat system, the outcome is positive. However, the game suffers from overly restrictive level design, poor storytelling, and an art direction that leaves much to be desired.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 emerges as a meeting point between Team Ninja's development philosophy, which led to the series' dazzling rebirth as a hardcore action game, and that of PlatinumGames, which, over the years, has become a true pillar of the genre. The combat system is still incredibly fun and at times exhilarating, and the new features introduced to the game world allow for a more satisfying progression than in the past. Given these premises, however, it's truly a shame that the same effort hasn't been put into the narrative, which unfortunately fails to capitalize on the excellent premise of the plot and ends up being a formulaic and lackluster tale. After over a decade of absence from the scene and given the names involved in the project, it was reasonable to expect a production effort of a different caliber.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a triumphant return for the series, with Team Ninja and PlatinumGames uniting to deliver the most intense and fluid combat the franchise has ever seen. Its dual-protagonist story between Yakumo and Ryu is beautifully told, with jaw-dropping dynamic gameplay sequences for both characters. A stellar score ties it all together, making Ninja Gaiden 4 one of 2025's best games and firmly cementing the franchise's grand return in the modern era.

>A new Ninja Gaiden for a new generation, Ninja Gaiden 4 features combat that's faster-paced and more intense than ever before. It's the most accessible, too, thanks to a range of difficulty levels and assists. It's just a shame that its new protagonist isn't a little more likeable.

>The story may not be the greatest but that’s not the primary reasons people play character action games. Ninja Gaiden 4 delivers with fun and fluid gameplay. After Ninja Gaiden 3 as well as the spinoff Yaiba left a lot to be desired, it’s a very welcome return to form and along with Ragebound being a great game, the future of Ninja Gaiden looks to be great.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a spectacular comeback that combines the strengths of the series with modern influences from Team Ninja and PlatinumGames. The combat system shines with fast-paced, precise, and mercilessly satisfying fights, while the staging and boss battles showcase the action genre at its best. Although the level design remains too conservative in places and does not fully exploit its creative potential, the thrilling action, stylish brutality, and successful gameplay make it a worthy and impressive successor that skillfully continues the legacy of Ryu Hayabusa.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a comeback. It’s fast, it’s furious, and it honours the legacy while turning up the tempo. Yakumo leads the charge with new mechanics, Ryu anchors it with familiar weight, traversal soars, combat slashes, bosses challenge. It isn’t flawless, repetition, some structuring echo past entries, and if you binge it you might feel the edges. But what it does best, it does with conviction. For fans of pure, no-nonsense action games, this hits hard. For those new to the series, it provides an accessible entry point without diluting the punch.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a fantastic, fun and challenging action game that fans of the genre will be coming back to many times, with tons of replay value and inevitable DLC expansions in the future.

>It's a demanding game, yes, but also a fair one. And, above all, it's an experience that restores that sense of pride after mastering a difficult battle, something that defines the true essence of Ninja Gaiden. For all these reasons, Ninja Gaiden 4 is one of the best surprises of the year, a title that not only revives a legendary franchise but also elevates it to a new standard within the action genre. If you love challenges, technical combat, and the purest Japanese style, this game is a must-have.

>NINJA GAIDEN 4 is far more than just a sequel. It is a true masterpiece. The game captures the essence of the legendary original and catapults it powerfully into the modern age. The fusion of Team NINJA's uncompromising fighting skills with PlatinumGames' stylish, dynamic action design is a direct hit. Every new mechanism and technical detail has been realised with a tangible passion for the original. The combination of tactical depth, technical finesse and outstanding accessibility makes NINJA GAIDEN 4 the action-adventure highlight of this generation.

>It’s been 13 long years since the last main entry in the Ninja Gaiden series, but the wait has been worth it. Ninja Gaiden and PlatinumGames are a match made in heaven as the combat is some of the most fun and exhilarating around, with tons of bloodshed and dismembered body parts.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 masterfully revives the series’ legacy, blending Team Ninja’s spirit with PlatinumGames’ flair. Yakumo’s journey delivers thrilling combat, massive boss fights, and a deep progression system that rewards skill and dedication. Despite camera flaws, repetitive environments, and Ryu Hayabusa’s limited role, it remains a brutal, stylish, and essential action game for fans and newcomers alike.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 feels right at home with the classic, linear design of the first three entries in the series. A focus on tight, fast-paced action lets the best aspects of the game sing, and it avoids muddying the water with unnecessary souls-like mechanics. A few boss fights feel a bit too janky for the action, but overall, they make for excellent mission endpoints. The story isn't exactly memorable, but it doesn't bog down the experience, making for a tight roller coaster of an action game worthy of the title Ninja Gaiden.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a brutal, spectacular, and incredibly satisfying return to the iconic series, reminding us why fans have longed for Ryu Hayabusa and the world of ninjas. PlatinumGames has delivered a dynamic combat system, fluid animations, and a diverse arsenal that make every battle a pure pleasure. While the story and Ryu's role are disappointing, and the ending loses momentum, the overall experience is redeemed by excellent gameplay and a constant sense of power. It's a great return for a critically acclaimed IP.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a bold new beginning for the series that brings a new dynamic to combat while still living up to the series' legacy. It may not be the Ninja Gaiden longtime fans were hoping for, but it's an excellent game and one of the best action titles of the generation.

>Maybe Ninja Gaiden 4 could be the weird transition game that helps the franchise find a new path in future entries. Like I said before, there is a good combat loop here. It just lacks the refinement and potency that fans have come to expect from this franchise. The Ninja Gaiden stories have never been complicated or over-the-top, but this one offers very little substantive content or drama to get its hooks in you. It's not perfect by any stretch of the word, but the right person can find a good time here.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a rock solid action game that delivers on what's most important - the combat. While some of the surrounding aspects are a little less successful, such as repeated environments and a forgettable story, the intense battles and myriad challenges are where the game shines, whether playing as Yakumo or Ryu. It doesn't hit every mark, but the simplistic structure, emphasis on technical combat, and even the cheesy performances combine for an action game that feels like it's from a bygone era, in the best way possible.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 delivers a fast, fluid, and brutally satisfying combat experience that stays true to the series' roots while evolving its gameplay with modern flair. The dual protagonists, deep mechanics, and intense metal soundtrack make every fight a thrill. While the visuals lag slightly behind today's standards and some repetition creeps in, the game's energy, challenge, and replay value make it a strong return for the legendary action series.

>Ninja Gaiden 4’s gruesome, lightning-fast trials respectably preserve and build upon the core of its ancestors. It should also introduce a whole new audience of challenge-seeking players to the joys of ninja limb-lopping and the pride of overcoming a blockbuster game that seems to give the player almost no quarter, even as its robust movement and deeply customizable fighting styles convey sleek, ruthless empowerment. It’s not perfect, but that sheer speed and aggression still builds a convincing case for what Team Ninja’s heroes offer that Dante and Kratos do not.

>I’ve tried to be as even-handed as possible with this review because I am a diehard Ninja Gaiden fan. I have played since the 8-bit days on the original Nintendo, and I also really dig Platinum Games and what they produce. If you are in one camp or the other, you’re either going to be pissed or you’re going to be happy. If you like both, you may end up confused, disappointed, or really happy, because Ninja Gaiden 4 isn’t really a proper Ninja Gaiden game nor is it a pure Platinum game.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is all about quality over quantity, and the quality is just incredible. The combat is fast-paced, brutal, flashy, and engaging, while still feeling accessible enough to use the diverse moveset and still require some skill to utilize to their fullest. With the gorgeous world, head-bopping soundtrack, and side content, I found many reasons to keep coming back for more even after finishing the campaign. There are some minor issues here and there, but nothing that stopped me from enjoying every moment.

>It also plays quite nicely on the Steam Deck. It does have a specific Steam Deck Mode that can play at 30 FPS, and while it can handle higher framerates, there are a multitude of issues that keep it from being an amazing experience. Still, it's playable, looks decent, and a solid way to enjoy the game.

>Ultimately, Ninja Gaiden 4 is fun, but not memorable -- something that extends into its general narrative. You're not there for witty banter though, nor for its plot twists and turns -- but instead to decapitate enemies as a bad-ass ninja. In that sense, Ninja Gaiden 4 does exactly what it says on the tin.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a rollercoaster of action, with a rich combat system to master and plenty of badass scenarios to overcome. Ryu's sections don't live up to the hype, nor does the writing. Even so, this is the best action game to come out in years, and perhaps Platinum's greatest hit yet.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 had a difficult task: navigating the heavy legacy of a series that has made difficulty one of its trademarks while also satisfying a new audience looking for deep but accessible action. Yakumo and Ryu's mission was accomplished with flying colours, and the latest addition to the Team Ninja saga is an extremely entertaining action game, but with a combat system ready to be dissected by the most demanding fans.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is not a game built for comfort. It is built for those who still believe that skill matters. Every cut, every dodge, every perfectly timed strike reinforces that belief. By the time the credits roll, one truth becomes clear: the way of the ninja has not been forgotten. It has merely been waiting for the right blade to bring it back to life.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 hardly re-writes the rules on what these kinds of games should look like, but fans who have been awaiting the return of the franchise may prefer this first re-entry takes things back to basics to some degree. Built in partnership between Koei, Microsoft, Team Ninja, and Platinum Games, Ninja Gaiden 4 has emerged a surprisingly coherent and confident product. Stunning and stylish hack n' slash gameplay could've been backed up with more compelling characters and story beats, but for those who simply want to carve a bloody path through endless enemies — Ninja Gaiden 4 is up there with the best of them.

>Ninja Gaiden 4 is a darn function action game that unfortunately avoids the heights that one might expect, given the pedigree of the developers. The very fun core combat shines, but everything surrounding it feels underbaked. The rushed ending and lackluster second character keep it from shining as brightly as it should. It's still a fun character action game with some satisfying and meaty combat, and it's something that fans of the genre should enjoy.

Reddit,1of1fml,The future of AI gains will be in De Novo Proteins. There is really only one way to invest early without going to Big Pharma,https://www.reddit.com/r/pennystocks/comments/1of1fml/the_future_of_ai_gains_will_be_in_de_novo/,"# **The De Novo Protein Revolution**


If you’ve seen the Veritasium video on AI protein design, you already know what’s coming.
 Link: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VGosZWBTFyY


That video explains how AI can now predict and design proteins with extreme accuracy. Proteins are the machinery of life, and for the first time, we can build new ones intentionally.

That's great and all, but where's the money?

# **Why Absci (ABSI) Might Be the Smartest High-Risk, High-Reward Play in AI Right Now**


AI has already changed how we think, write, and build. But the biggest transformation is about to happen in biology.


The future of medicine won’t come from finding molecules in nature. It will come from designing new ones from scratch.


That is what Absci does.


They use generative AI to create de novo proteins—brand-new proteins built by design, not discovery. These can become new drugs, enzymes, or even regenerative treatments. It’s a total shift in how medicine is made.


Absci’s system goes even further. Their AI designs millions of protein candidates, and their automated lab physically builds and tests them. The data then feeds back into the model so each new cycle gets smarter. They call it “AI Drug Creation,” and it’s exactly what it sounds like—AI making new drugs that have never existed before.

# **Why Absci Is Different**


Every other serious player in this field is locked inside a major corporation or still private.


- DeepMind and Isomorphic Labs belong to Google.


- EvolutionaryScale is funded by Amazon.


- Recursion is partnered with Roche.


Absci is the only independent, publicly traded company focused entirely on AI-based de novo protein design. That gives regular investors a unique shot at a field that will likely reshape biotech over the next decade.


They also have partnerships with Almirall, Oracle, and AMD, which gives them both scientific and computing credibility. And they recently raised enough capital to be funded well into 2028. That means they can deliver data without constant fundraising or dilution.

# **The Baldness Program That Could Change Everything**


Absci’s most exciting project right now is ABS-201, a potential treatment for pattern baldness.
It targets the prolactin receptor, which plays a role in hair follicle miniaturization. In testing, ABS-201 achieved full hair regrowth in 22 days in mice, while 5 percent minoxidil (Rogaine’s active ingredient) only achieved partial regrowth in the same period.


In primate studies, it showed over 90 percent bioavailability and a long half-life, meaning it could be taken once every few months instead of daily. If those results hold up in humans, it would outperform both Rogaine and finasteride by a wide margin.


Absci is hosting a baldness-focused conference on December 11 where they are expected to reveal new progress and additional data on this program. If they confirm results close to what they’ve shown so far, it could be a major turning point for the company and the stock.
The hair loss market has more than 80 million potential patients in the U.S. alone, with billions spent annually on treatments that barely work. A truly effective biologic would be a category killer.

# **Where Things Stand**


Absci also has ABS-101, a drug in human testing for inflammatory bowel disease. Results from that study will be the company’s first human clinical data and could validate their AI platform in real-world medicine.


Between that and the upcoming December 11 event, Absci has multiple near-term catalysts that could drive significant attention and value.
Their partnerships, data generation speed, and multi-year cash runway give them breathing room to prove their model works.

# **The Risk and the Reward**


Absci is small, volatile, and early. It’s not a stock for anyone who needs safety or short-term certainty. But it is one of the few companies sitting on the edge of a once-in-a-generation scientific shift.


If AI-designed proteins become standard in drug creation, Absci could be the name that helped start it. The upside is enormous, even if the path there is risky.

# **TL;DR**
Ticker: ABSI


- Focus: AI-driven design of new proteins for medicine and therapy


- Why unique: Only public company fully dedicated to this field


- Upcoming catalyst: Baldness program (ABS-201) update on December 11


- Other program: ABS-101 for inflammatory bowel disease, human testing already underway


- Cash runway: Funded into 2028


- Potential: Could be the NVIDIA of biotech if AI protein design takes off


- Risk: Early-stage biotech volatility, dependent on data

Reddit,1odiebw,New phone sized ereader,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odiebw,"Got my hands on the new Xiaomi InkPalm Mini Plus 2. I had been looking for a semi-affordable ereader that I could easily toss in my pocket for when I wanted a quick read, but not be distracted by a phone. 

After reading about half a dozen small ereaders, I found out this one was released just last month. It’s only on JD and it’s not marketed outside of China, so I wasn’t sure what I’d be getting into - I was prepared to be doing a lot of translating.

To my surprise, the device had an English setting on the first screen and 85% of everything is in really good English (I mean it seems like someone took the time to do a real translation).

Anyway, for the size and price, this thing is a beast. It’s got a RK3566 Quad Cortex A55 @ 1.8GHz processor, 6GB of RAM, and a completely unnecessary 512GB of storage. It has a front light and warm light setting and unlike previous iterations, a matte screen. Resolution is 276ppi -  which is pretty good for 5.86-inch screen.

It is NOT a phone and doesn’t try to be one. That was a selling point for me. No camera, no SIM card, etc. it has wifi, Bluetooth and a native browser, but I just want to read books on it without a dozen distractions.

It runs Android 14 with its own App Store, which I was surprised to KOreader. I installed that, updated it and deleted the other reading apps. 

I was able to connect to my CWA server and download my epubs, and install the CWA progress sync plug-in so I can sync my reading progress across my other devices with KOreader (jailbroken Kindles).

So far, so good. This thing is pretty snappy, the screen is just big enough to feel comfortable reading, the volume buttons work to turn pages, it is incredibly light weight and feels well-made.

It cost me a bit less than an Boox Palma 2 - at least where I live. At the time of purchase last week it was around USD $195 before shipping, but looks like it’s currently around $175.

Hope this doesn’t read like an ad. I just saw a few posts a month ago about the device, but no one with a hands on - so thought I would give my impression.

Reddit,1ogjijr,"EU buyer here: Google refuses to fix shortened warranty on a brand new phone, support is absolutely useless",https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ogjijr/eu_buyer_here_google_refuses_to_fix_shortened/,"I bought a brand new Google Pixel 9 Pro XL from O2 in Slovakia, which is officially listed on Google’s website as an authorized reseller since Google does not have any official physical store here in Europe. 
The phone was sealed and never used, purchased in June 2025.

When I checked the warranty on Google’s support page, it showed the phone as purchased in January — five months before I actually bought it.
The warranty was already shortened to less than 24 months, even though EU law guarantees a full 24-month warranty for new products.

After some digging, it seems Google started the warranty countdown from the day the phone arrived in O2’s stock, not from the day it was sold to me. That’s clearly wrong and against EU consumer law.

So I contacted Google support to get it corrected. That’s when the nightmare started.

They told me O2 isn’t an authorized reseller, even though it’s literally listed on Google’s official site.

O2 confirmed they have no access or ability to change anything in Google’s warranty system.

When I went back to Google with that, they just repeated the same false info and closed the case.

At one point, Google support even offered to remotely check the phone’s internal system logs to verify that it hadn’t been used before I purchased it. I agreed, and they confirmed exactly that — the phone was first activated after my purchase date.
And even after confirming it themselves, they still refused to fix the warranty.

Every agent I spoke to gave copy-pasted or contradictory replies. 
Under both EU law and Google’s own warranty policy, Google is responsible for honoring the full 24-month warranty for products sold by authorized resellers. Passing the blame is not just lazy — it’s unacceptable.

This whole experience has been absurd.

TL;DR:
Bought a new Google phone from O2 (authorized reseller).
Google’s system says it was bought 5 months earlier → shortened warranty.
Google checked the phone logs remotely and confirmed it hadn’t been used before purchase → still refused to fix the warranty.
Support keeps giving false info and closing the case.

Has anyone else in the EU had a wrong purchase date or shortened warranty on a new Google phone? Did you ever get Google to fix it?",GooglePixel,martin_lng,115,0.89,84,2025-10-26 18:05:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/GooglePixel/comments/1ogjijr/eu_buyer_here_google_refuses_to_fix_shortened/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""new phone""'"

Reddit,1ofji6t,New phone detection camera appears along the busy North-South Motorway,https://www.reddit.com/r/Adelaide/comments/1ofji6t/new_phone_detection_camera_appears_along_the_busy/,"A mobile phone detection camera has been rigged at a major motorway – without any public announcements – next to the state’s top fine hotspot. The cameras have been installed on the northbound North-South Motorway gantry, near the Croydon FC at Regency Park early last week. The cameras at their new location are already busily pinging drivers and issuing fines.

An SA Police spokesman said these spy-cams were originally located at Torrensville but were moved further north due to the roadworks. “The mobile phone detection cameras at South Rd, Torrensville were relocated to the North-South Motorway, Regency Park,” he told The Advertiser. “The relocation was undertaken due to realignment works for the River Torrens to Darlington (T2D) Project. “The cameras were installed on existing digital variable message signs and are now monitoring northbound traffic.”

Previously, it was revealed the cameras racked up more than $30 million in fines and levies in their first six-months, with the city the North-South Motorway city-bound lanes alone capturing the most misbehaving drivers. In six-month the North-South Motorway city-bound lanes pinged 12,645 drivers, while South Rd at Torrensville followed second catching out 11,828 motorists, while the Southern Expressway at Darlington followed behind with 9482.

Drivers caught illegally using their phones will face fines of $556, plus a $104 Victims of Crime Levy, as well as three demerit points. Amendments to the Australian road laws made earlier in June last year forbid drivers from holding mobile phones in any capacity, including in their lap.

The app constantly puts whatever price it feels like randomly onto my Buy It Now, so I have to manually go in and edit all the time. Even though I triple check before listing. 

I always have to “save draft” then go in and enter the price option for international shipping since it won’t let me adjust it while creating the listing. I can’t just list, it says “you didn’t enter international shipping” but the glitch won’t let me fix it even then. 

There’s no convenient option for duration so I have to leave everything up indefinitely, and I can’t change it once it’s begun. 

If I look up past auction or something on Safari while listing it opens the eBay app and doesn’t save a draft so I have to start all over again. 

I have 12 feedbacks in the last month and when I go to look at it there’s only 2 feedbacks from the past month displayed.

I can’t click on the item or the buyer to leave feedback for them, I have to go all the way back into my orders, select the item, and leave feedback there. 

——

These are major technical issues here. 

Last time I complained someone was like “use your desktop.” No. I’m already having to take multiple extra steps. It takes a half hour minimum to create one listing. Taking pics on my phone, uploading them to desktop and selecting individually would be even more.

If you’re taking 20% of everything I make on eBay, you should be able to afford keeping your app up to speed. 

I really need to find another selling platform.

Reddit,1odbfqc,New headphones (P9 Plus model) pick up a stange frequency - a man speaking in seemingly a middle eastern language and distant screams,https://v.redd.it/ygay8ds2mowf1,"The headphone has four buttons — one for pausing music, one for skipping songs, one for restarting. But the fourth button does something… really weird.

Whenever we press it, the headphones start picking up what sounds like a radio frequency — but not like any normal station. We hear a man speaking in a language I don’t recognize, and the audio quality is rough, almost distorted. Sometimes there are distant screams or shouting, like people far away. Other times, a woman’s voice cuts in briefly she also talk about something, or we’ll hear cars passing by. Every now and then there’s this deep “brrrrr” noise that sounds mechanical or electronic. 

I recorded the part where the man speak. I guess ıt's Arabic or Persian. But not sure.

Why smth like this even happen? Why did they add a button for this?? And what is this in the first place?

Right now I have a couple of Airpods Pro 2, these are fine and I am planning to use them while commuting/outdoors. I am looking for a pair of headphones to use indoors. I primarily listen to classical music, operas and film scores and would really like to ""feel"" the music, like close to the way it feels when you listen to an orchestra play live, or when you watch a movie in theaters. My apologies, I don't have a great vocabulary or knowledge when it comes to this stuff, so I don't know much about bass, treble, acoustic balance, etc, but I definitely want to learn. I am hoping someone familiar with the genres I listed could give me advice on what I am looking for in a headphone to enhance the sound of those genres :)

I have no real budget because I am willing to save up, however I would like something that is good straight out of the box that I don't need to buy an amplifier for (at least right now, maybe in the future!). I use a Macbook Air that has a 3.5 mm jack and my iPhone that has a lightning connector so I could buy a dongle. Feel free to criticise this setup! I imagine i will expand this in the future, but this is what I am working with right now.

Reddit,1od5unl,New headphones and microphone,https://www.reddit.com/r/buildapc/comments/1od5unl/new_headphones_and_microphone/,"Hi everyone,

I’m looking to upgrade my PC audio setup. Right now, I’m using the HyperX Cloud Alpha headset along with its built-in microphone.

Recently, I picked up a Focusrite Scarlett 2i2 (3rd gen) and an MXL 990 for about 70€, which seemed like a great deal — so I went for it. However, using the Cloud Alpha with this setup doesn’t really make much sense, since the headset doesn’t benefit from the Scarlett at all. On top of that, the MXL 990 picks up a lot of background noise (especially my keyboard), which isn’t ideal for gaming or meetings.

I’d like to keep the Scarlett, but I’m open to changing the rest of the hardware. If you have recommendations for headphones or a microphone that would work well with it, I’d really appreciate it. Alternatively, if you think a gaming headset with a good built-in mic would make more sense for my use case, I’m open to that too.

The setup will mainly be used for gaming with friends and office work (lots of meetings). My budget is around 150–200€.

I've been really excited about Arc Raiders and I know the game puts a heavy emphasis on audio design and directional sound cues. I'm currently using basic stereo headphones and I'm wondering if it's worth upgrading to a proper headset with 360° or 3D spatial audio specifically for this game.

For those who've played or followed the development closely:

* Does the audio positioning actually make a significant difference in gameplay?
* Is it crucial for detecting enemy movements/threats, or is good stereo enough?
* Would you say spatial audio gives a competitive advantage, or is it more of a ""nice to have""?

Reddit,1odwnys,Looking for new headphones for my PC and saxophone practice,https://www.reddit.com/r/HeadphoneAdvice/comments/1odwnys/looking_for_new_headphones_for_my_pc_and/,"I’m looking for a new pair of headphones and could really use some advice. My budget is around 100-150 euros, and I live in Spain.

They’ll be used in my house and for two different purposes:

1. On my PC, for listening to jazz (that’s what I mostly listen to), songs like *Foreigner – Urgent*, some modern music, movies, series, and a bit of gaming.
2. On my phone or tablet, when I’m playing saxophone or transcribing jazz solos (I usually practice in another room to avoid disturbing others).

I don’t want wireless headphones, I prefer wired.

What I’m looking for:

* A balanced sound with a bit of warmth and presence in the low end, but not overwhelming.
* Something that feels full-bodied, since many headphones I’ve tried sound kind of “thin.” I often use Equalizer APO + Peace to fix that, maybe because I’ve never owned good headphones.
* Comfort is very important, I wear glasses and use headphones for many hours a day. In the past, gaming headsets would press on the top of my head and hurt my ears.
* I’m leaning toward open-back or semi-open headphones, since that might be better for playing saxophone and hearing me. I also don’t like isolation; I need to be aware of what’s going on around me.

The only thing I’m not sure about is how much open headphones leak sound, could people nearby hear my music easily? I sometimes work from home in my computer near others that are sleeping and wouldn’t want to bother them, so maybe semi-open would be a better choice?

I’ve only ever used closed-back headphones, so I’d appreciate any guidance on what might suit me best.

I’d really appreciate knowing whether the headphones you recommend would require or benefit from any additional equipment (especially for the computer).

Reddit,1ocfy1a,Sennheiser HDB 630 – A Wireless Audiophile Blend of the MOMENTUM 4 and the HD 650? [Review],https://www.reddit.com/r/headphones/comments/1ocfy1a/sennheiser_hdb_630_a_wireless_audiophile_blend_of/,"[HDB 630 - still boxed up](https://preview.redd.it/m0vqzwyjvcwf1.jpg?width=4549&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=bcaa2dab2fca797e3f7deab0fdca11f5d7e5ce8f)

# HDB 630 Intro:

So, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.

This time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!

This new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*

Marketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?

# This is what’s included in the box:

The included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. 

**You get:**

https://preview.redd.it/n8uhoux3mewf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=10e7821554fcab0a8469531d608b5560631f25c6

* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.
* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.
* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.
* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. 
* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.

All in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.

# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: 

The HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: 

There’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. 

Other changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.

The general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.

[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/l44nwb76newf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c9bd5d3a117b2c58c8f3cac064d827d565298981)

Otherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.

That said, it is worth noting that the earcups have been made slightly taller, and inside them, there is a new acoustic system which is designed to deliver refined vocals, crisper details, dynamic bass, and a more open, natural soundstage. It essentially consists of a combination of enhanced internal damping, an optimized back volume, and a new acoustic mesh. 

The design changes can be seen in the following two images:

# Sound Signature, App Support and Features:

When it comes to sound (and features), this is where things get serious — the HDB 630 has to shine and flex its muscles here in order to justify its launch price of €499! After all, its direct competitors in the premium wireless price range include headphones like premium offerings from Bowers & Wilkins or the Focal Bathys e.g. — but… are they really?

In a way, your instinct is to immediately say “yes,” since the HDB 630 sits pretty much right in the middle of the price range between those two wireless headphones. However, it aims to stand out from the competition by appealing to more demanding listeners through its explicitly “audiophile” tuning philosophy and innovative features such as a parametric equalizer and crossfeed in the Smart Control Plus app — a combination that’s still pretty unique on the market right now.

In my opinion, that’s exactly what makes the HDB 630 such an interesting product and more than just a “MOMENTUM 4 with a few new extra features.” The HDB 630 is trying to bridge the gap between a wireless closed-back headphone and true audiophile performance.

This becomes especially clear when looking at the comparisons Sennheiser themselves provide to promote and position the HDB 630. So, let’s first take a look at three frequency response graphs of the HDB 630 compared to the MOMENTUM 4, the reference-grade open-back HD 650, and the closed-back HD 620S \[Source: Sennheiser-Hearing\]:

[HDB 630 has a more natural approach here: less bass, a more balanced midrange and a detailed, yet smoother top end](https://preview.redd.it/zzxrvi1uoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8be36a3b7f353db38306b7b74bfd57039f06ebc6)

[HDB 630 clearly has more bass and especially more bass extension, yet the midrange is strikingly similar to that of the HD 650.](https://preview.redd.it/2owzfnozoewf1.jpg?width=1920&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a702fa5b7e32dd1dcbb7f0092fe20fd5789e0bd4)

[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/zbvyfli7pewf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=8ac19f4580531adc23adff3206643b053e002ec7)



Strictly on paper, the HDB 630 is essentially a blend of a technically refined, more advanced, and more audiophile version of the MOMENTUM 4 — but tuned much more neutrally and naturally, with less emphasis on both bass and treble, and tries to represent a closed-back, wireless and audiophile take on something like the HD 650.

Its (especially midrange) frequency heavily resembles that of the HD 650, yet it offers noticeably more bass extension, aiming to address one of the HD 650’s often-mentioned “criticisms” while deviating in the treble region again for smooth(er), yet still detailed high frequencies. 

Compared to the also very capable closed-back but passive HD 620S — whose frequency response is often described and perceived as somewhat uneven or “erratic” in parts — the curve of the HDB 630 looks far more homogeneous, neutral, and well-balanced at first glance. 

Keep in mind that we’re only referring to the stock “neutral” EQ of the HDB 630 here — without yet touching on its key selling points like the parametric EQ or crossfeed, which will be covered in a minute. As for the app, it basically offers everything MOMENTUM 4 users are already familiar with, while adding the aforementioned parametric EQ and crossfeed features.

# Real World Sound Impressions:

As mentioned earlier, the HDB 630 can be connected via Bluetooth, wired through USB-C, or with a 3.5 mm jack — just like the MOMENTUM 4. What’s new, however, is that you now benefit from 24-bit / 96 kHz playback both wirelessly and via USB-C cable — something that wasn’t possible with the M4, where this was limited to wireless use only.

Regardless of which connection method I’ve used so far, I honestly notice a clear difference between the HDB 630 and the MOMENTUM 4 every single time! The new Sennheiser headphone definitely sounds best to me via USB-C, very closely followed by the Bluetooth connection using the included BTD 700 dongle which also sounds fantastic! This was already the case with the M4, but the level of sound quality offered here is noticeably better in both cases! Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.

The bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.

The mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.

The presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.

Overall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. 

So, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…

[HDB 630 + BTD 700 + iPhone 17 Pro Max](https://preview.redd.it/upd9od9mpewf1.jpg?width=2936&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=df78975d7d34e4b70227e94d99749b56e486a41f)

# Crossfeed:

In the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”

https://preview.redd.it/g43kzbvwpewf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5f626147762de7f0320f60e5fc087f42c48e7f23

Crossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.

Crossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.

Since this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!

# Parametric EQ:

This is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!

The major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.

Finally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.

And for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.

Personally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.

Of course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!

Here are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:

[The new parametric EQ in the Smart Control Plus app](https://preview.redd.it/2slrbdzsqewf1.png?width=1320&format=png&auto=webp&s=7cbd570053924d621870b7ca72ccdde5aefb5e0f)

There’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff.

# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: 

Let’s keep this section short and simple for a change. 

The ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. 

With regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.

https://preview.redd.it/9qfl8klnrewf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a29349cd302528b6af2ee40b3e208e95b669192

# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)

Phew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? 

For me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”

It uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.

The sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.

Feature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.

ANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.

In essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. 

Coming in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!

# Final Verdict:

The Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period.

# HDB 630 Intro:

So, this is it! Sennheiser’s long-awaited new wireless headphone model, arriving more than three years after their latest wireless consumer flagship, the MOMENTUM 4.

This time, though, things are a bit different! It’s not called the MOMENTUM 5, but rather the “HDB 630.” At first glance, you might say it looks a lot like the M4 — and you wouldn’t be wrong. It indeed uses the same chassis as the 2022 flagship, but with a few seemingly minor, yet ultimately very important, differences. More on that in a moment, though!

This new headphone is a closed-back model, and “HDB” stands for „Headphone Dynamic Bluetooth“. The number 630 indicates that it belongs to the 600 series of headphones — just like the – also closed-back - HD 620S, for example. Sennheiser describes the HDB 630 as *“a complementary alternative to the HD 650 and an audiophile upgrade from the MOMENTUM 4.”*

Marketing words aside, this immediately sets the expectations sky high in my book – is this really *the* audiophile wireless headphone Sennheiser fans have been waiting for? I’ve been an M4 user myself for roughly three years now and also happen to own the HD 600, 650, 660S2 and the 3HD 620S – so, let’s find out if this really turns out to be *“audiophile sound, cut loose”,* shall we?

# This is what’s included in the box:

The included accessories for the HDB 630 go well beyond the headphones themselves. 

You get:

https://preview.redd.it/5q8p644licwf1.jpg?width=6367&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=cfdfa3dcb731cb321b02df28eb9b053e0760e0d3

* A high-quality carrying case, similar to the one that comes with the M4, but sturdier and seemingly also more durable. Even small details, like the metal zipper, are improved in direct comparison.
* Sennheiser’s BTD 700 Bluetooth USB dongle, capable of aptX Lossless and aptX Adaptive codecs with up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution audio.
* A USB-C to USB-C cable, supporting audio via USB-C and also up to 24-bit/96 kHz high-resolution sound.
* A “normal” 2.5 mm to 3.5 mm analogue audio cable. 
* An Airplane flight adapter as well as manuals and instruction sheets.

All in all, you’ll find almost every connection option you could wish for in a headphone like this. I personally would have preferred a more flexible USB-C cable, since wired listening via USB-C is a key feature — but that’s a minor nitpick. Besides, you can use any USB-C cable you have or prefer, so it’s not really an issue.

# Materials, Build Quality, Design and Comfort: 

The HDB 630 is similarly built and has a similar design to the MOMENTUM 4 but comes with a couple of neat new changes and technical upgrades: 

There’s the new headband made from “Ideatex Japan leatherette“ for enhanced reliability and a new paint on the earcups to reduce fingerprint marks. The headband feels nice indeed and I can confirm that during my initial testing time with the headphone, fingerprints are not really an issue on the outer earcups. 

Other changes include slightly deeper earcups (4.5 mm) – a *very* welcome change – and a new silver paint scheme on the yoke and sliders which kind of gives the impression of metal while still benefitting from the light weight of the composite material we are used to from the M4. The HDB 630 adds roughly 20 g to the weight of the M4, now coming in at 311 g, but the weight distribution is very good, and the headphones have felt very comfortable every time I’ve used them so far.

The general build quality is very good, with no signs of creaking or other unwanted noises on my unit.

[The new headband](https://preview.redd.it/flbccyv5jcwf1.jpg?width=3023&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d2356409f3e220141cba9daf0bb5ecee9bb21c76)

Otherwise, there are few *obvious* design changes compared to the M4, as the outer chassis, as mentioned earlier, has largely remained the same.

Vs. HD 620S

[The HDB 630 behaves much more balanced than the HD 620S, with fewer peaks and dips across the entire frequency spectrum.](https://preview.redd.it/84p84d2nkcwf1.png?width=1600&format=png&auto=webp&s=4acfbfd16202c99771d615480015480dc43e9409)

Wirelessly, the sound is virtually on par with the wired version — and when a wireless setup can sound *this* good (yes, that’s the headphone, not the codec!), I honestly don’t mind doing without aptX Lossless or even LDAC.

The bass feels a bit leaner and tighter, more defined, more precise, and faster — and therefore immediately less “consumer-oriented.” This is where the more audiophile tuning first becomes noticeable. The transition into the mids is smooth, yet the bass manages to clearly delineate the two frequency ranges without getting in the way, as is often the case with “typical” consumer headphones (and, to some extent, even with the M4). Still, there’s more than enough presence and punch in the low end, so no one needs to worry that the HDB 630 might be lacking in bass.

The mids come across very smoothly — truly “HD 600 series-like” — and are, to me, the real highlight of the HDB 630 tuning. Vocals sound lifelike and realistic, just as you’d usually expect from a Sennheiser’s audiophile headphone, and thanks in part to the bass tuning, they’re less nasal or “hollow” than what you often get with many closed-back designs. The presence region is also simply clearer and less muddy or veiled. The mids sound warm and balanced, with no unpleasant peaks or sibilance to be heard.

The presence range around 3 to 4 kHz is emphasized — slightly more so than on the M4 even — yet the treble as a whole is a smoother and more pleasant, without sacrificing detail, finesse, or that sense of airiness. I find vocals on this headphone to be relatively intimate, which again brings to mind the HD 650 (and remember, we’re still talking about a closed-back here). Still, the HDB 630 manages to convey a certain airiness that gives the overall sound a more spacious, detailed and breathable quality. Instruments also come through with great transparency and clarity on the HDB 630.

Overall, it can be said that the sound of the HDB 630 is clearly less v-shaped compared to the MOMENTUM 4 and, instead, significantly more neutral and lifelike. The pure sound quality comes across as more refined, detailed, and — yes — more audiophile. It also seems to me that there’s a bit more headroom in terms of the overall available volume. 

So, the HDB 630 *does* feel like a closed-back and wireless hybrid for on the go between the M4 and the HD 650 in all the best closed-back ways possible. I could end here and be happy about this headphone as this alone is an achievement in itself for me. However, there is still more…

# Crossfeed:

In the Smart Control Plus app, you’ll now find the “Crossfeed” feature with the options “Off,” “Low,” and “High.”

https://preview.redd.it/amsgfc7llcwf1.jpg?width=1284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8c1f3eae2462ccaac36dfc2de2dd3ff62d627c72

Crossfeed is basically an audio technique that aims to simulate a more natural listening experience by blending a small portion of the left audio channel into the right channel (and vice versa) with a slight delay. It’s a function that improves the listening experience of hard-panned albums. Just in case you’re wondering, a hard-panned album is one where the left and right stereo channels are mixed extremely — or even completely — separated. That means certain instruments or vocals are sent entirely to the left channel while others are sent entirely to the right, with little or nothing placed in the center.

Crossfeed on the HDB 630 helps to reduce this extreme stereo effect (the hard left-right separation) so that the result sounds more like listening through loudspeakers — with better spatial imaging and a less fatiguing experience overall.

Since this effect is mainly present in older recordings, those benefit the most from crossfeed, whereas modern tracks or albums tend to show much smaller or more subtle differences. Modern mixing generally keeps key elements (like vocals, bass, and kick drum) centered for better balance and realism right from the start. Therefore, I mostly tried crossfeed with recordings by The Beatles, “California Dreaming’” by The Mamas and the Papas, and the original version of “Brothers in Arms” by Dire Straits e.g. — and the results were very obvious and pleasing indeed. It’s a great and innovative addition to a wireless headphone setup, and I’m glad it’s there!

# Parametric EQ:

This is, of course, the biggest new feature and innovation compared to the MOMENTUM 4! The fully customizable 5-band parametric EQ is a true game-changer for audiophiles who have long wished for something like this — both on the go and at home!

The major advantage of having a manufacturer-implemented solution directly within the app (as opposed to using a third-party EQ app) is that all adjustments are stored on the headphones themselves. This means we can benefit from our personal tuning regardless of which device we connect the HDB 630 to — or even when switching between devices.

Finally, audiophiles — and those aspiring to become one — can truly fine-tune their own sound. Any subtle annoyance, personal preference, or individual perception can be addressed and “fixed” with precision. Those who were not entirely satisfied with the standard 5-band EQ of the MOMENTUM 4 or didn’t achieve their desired results with Sound Personalization can now breathe a sigh of relief, I guess :D The parametric EQ offers full control over frequencies, bandwidth, and filter characteristics.

And for anyone who finds this too complex at first (which is understandable — there’s a bit of a learning curve with parametric EQs, even though Sennheiser has made the interface very user-friendly and visually appealing), the familiar EQ options from the MOMENTUM 4 are still available as well.

Personally, I’m especially excited about the upcoming feature that will allow users to share their EQ presets via QR code — a brilliant and fun idea that, according to Sennheiser, will be added in a future update.

Of course, I’ve already spent quite some time experimenting with the new parametric EQ, but I also focused on getting to know the HDB 630’s own tuning and sound signature first — especially in direct comparison to the MOMENTUM 4. And it’s a really good thing that I already like the stock sound of the HDB 630 so much — it means I don’t really *need* to rely on fine-tuning to enjoy how they sound. Still, it’s fantastic to have this option available at all times!

Here are some pictures of what the new EQ looks like in the app:

There’s even an A/B comparison button that lets you quickly switch between two different EQ presets you’ve created or are working on, as well as a bypass feature to compare your custom EQ against the stock sound of the HDB 630. Wonderful stuff.

# ANC, Transparency Mode, Call Quality and Battery Life: 

Let’s keep this section short and simple for a change. 

The ANC seems pretty much identical to me compared to the M4 – which means it is good (and better than its reputation, actually) but far from the best out there. Definitely (more than) sufficient for me, though. The same applies to the transparency mode and the call quality. 

With regard to battery life, the HDB 630 can run for up to 60 hours at standard resolution and when using aptX Adaptive 24-bit/96 kHz with the BTD 700 e.g., they can still run for up to 45 hours.

https://preview.redd.it/o3gpfp8fmcwf1.jpg?width=7759&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7e67d6d569322e52d8ba437d1d3f38327570cf68

# Summary, Value (and TL; DR)

Phew. So, what exactly is the HDB 630 then? 

For me: Sennheiser’s most audiophile wireless headphone to date — and a genuinely smart and innovative evolution rather than just a “MOMENTUM 4 Plus.”

It uses almost the same chassis as the M4 but refines nearly everything that matters: slightly deeper earcups, upgraded materials, a new acoustic system and damping, and an entirely reworked tuning that clearly aims to bridge the gap between the wireless MOMENTUM line and the classic HD 600 series. The result is a closed-back, wireless headphone that sounds like a true Sennheiser audiophile product.

The sound signature is much more neutral and natural than the M4 with a tighter, faster bass, beautifully smooth mids with that typical HD 650 warmth and realism, and highs that are more refined and less fatiguing while keeping plenty of air and detail. Vocals in particular sound fantastic, in my opinion.  Via USB-C (24-bit / 96 kHz) or the included BTD 700 dongle via aptX Adaptive, the HDB 630 delivers an impressively clean and articulate presentation that goes far beyond your regular “consumer tuning.

Feature-wise, Sennheiser has stepped it up with a fully parametric 5-band EQ, complete with an A/B toggle and upcoming QR code sharing — with all settings stored directly on the headphone. Combined with the new Crossfeed option (inspired by the legendary HE 1, by the way), we audio enthusiasts can now tailor the experience from analytical to relaxed listening on the fly.

ANC, transparency, and call quality remain on MOMENTUM 4 level: solid but not class-leading. Battery life also remains excellent at up to 60 hours (around 45 hours with hi-res playback), and build quality feels a touch more premium thanks to small but thoughtful design tweaks like the new and more premium headband.

In essence and to me personally, the HDB 630 is exactly what many of us audiophiles hoped for — a more refined, more neutral, and more audiophile MOMENTUM 4, technically more capable and combining the convenience of wireless listening with the tonal maturity of Sennheiser’s legendary open-back heritage. It’s definitely not a noise-cancelling king, but it also doesn’t try to be. 

Coming in at just under €500, it’s certainly not a cheap wireless headphone and about €150 more than the M4’s launch MSRP three years ago. That said, I think it can easily compete with the (more expensive) likes of the Focal Bathys or Bowers & Wilkins PX8 while adding the BTD 700 dongle as well as features those headphones simply can’t match — making the asking price feel quite a bit more justified here!

# Final Verdict: 

The Sennheiser HDB 630 is a beautifully tuned, technically quite impressive, and versatile headphone that finally brings a touch of HD 650-like realism into a wireless, closed-back form factor and combines it with everything that was already great about the MOMENTUM 4 and then some. For anyone who values sound quality and versatility first, this is without a doubt the most complete Sennheiser wireless headphone yet and surely one of the very best wireless headphones on the market right now – period.

The quick summary:

1. I took my 1-year old leased electric car in for a software upgrade at the beginning of the month.
   1. a. The vehicle is a Honda Prologue.
2. The software upgrade is considered under warranty and repairs known software defects with the vehicle, some of which are safety-related. I have documentation stating this.
3. The dealer performed the software upgrade incorrectly. They verbally told me this. My car is semi-bricked due to the software upgrade-- it can be driven, but without any sort of screen or displays.
4. The dealer pressured me to drive the car off the lot and wait for a fix. I refused because I was unsure if the car was safe to drive in this condition.
5. The dealer has provided me a free loaner while they have my car. It is by no means comparable to what I am paying month-to-month for.
6. The dealer has made a few attempts to fix the car, but have failed. No progress has been made this month.
7. The dealer has confirmed to me that the manufacturer of the car does not have a known solution to remedy the issue, and they do not expect to know any more information for at least another month.
8. The car is over 12K miles-- in PA, this is outside of lemon law territory unfortunately.
9. I believe that since the vehicle entered the dealership functional, it should leave the dealership functional and they have an obligation to fulfill within a reasonable time frame under the Magnuson Moss Warranty Act.

Reddit,1odfayx,I Rode the ALSO TM-B: Rivian Micromobility Startup’s First EV,https://v.redd.it/fjr6l12yapwf1,"I just spent the day in San Francisco riding a bike unlike any other I’ve ever ridden. This is it. It’s not your average looking or functioning bike—and that may not come as a surprise once you hear it’s the result of that secret skunkworks project that spun out of automaker Rivian earlier this year. ALSO, that’s the company’s name. ALSO. Also, the ALSO TM-B (as its called) costs $4,500. Yeah. But before you click away thinking this is just another absurdly priced Silicon Valley fever dream, you need to understand that this thing isn’t *really* a bike. It’s a vehicle—and that’s not some marketing mumbo-jumbo I’m being paid to say. ALSO didn't sponsor this, they have no editorial control, and no first preview rights. I’ll show you why I consider it a vehicle, but first, you need to understand that the $100B+ cycling industry is hurting with multiple large manufacturers filing for bankruptcy just this year.

Post-COVID retractions and new tariffs mean now is an awful time to launch a premium e-bike. Furthermore, the market is fractured: at the low end, you've got cheap Chinese bikes with primitive tech and zero margins. At the high end, the tech is great but prices are bonkers. DJI—the drone maker famous for undercutting everyone—just launched a bike reviewers are calling an incredible value… at *eight thousand dollars*.

And look, there's a sliver of the market buying recreational e-bikes who might stomach those prices. But most people adopting e-bikes want transportation—to replace car trips. And when your ""affordable vehicle alternative"" costs as much as a decent used Honda Civic, something's broken. The problem is mostly structural. Almost every e-bike maker is essentially an assembler buying white-labeled motors from Bosch or Bafang, batteries from Panasonic or Samsung, displays, controllers, and mechanical hardware from yet more vendors, and bolting it all together. Rad Power Bikes' entire value proposition is literally that: import everything, assemble cheap, undercut on price. Which works! But there's only so much innovation you can do with other people's parts. Everyone's bikes end up with similar capabilities, limitations, and pricing because everyone's paying the same suppliers for the same components. ALSO's solution is to stop treating e-bikes like bikes. Build a vertically integrated vehicle platform from the ground up—own the motors, batteries, electronics, software—exactly like Tesla did for electric cars. Or, ya know, like Rivian…

I’ll be honest: when I first saw the ALSO TM-B, I thought it looked ugly. There’s a step-through frame with this chunky centered abscess attached to a big downtube and seat post with wimpy looking brakes. But over two hours with it, it started to click… this isn’t styled like a bike. And I don't mean that in the pejorative ""designed by committee"" way—I mean it's clearly designed with manufacturing and functionality as the primary constraints, with aesthetics as a distant third.

There’s a chunky, structural, magnesium heart that houses almost everything: the motor mounts to it. The battery latches into it. The rear suspension pivots on it. The seat mates with it. And it utilizes ""zonal architecture""—a term borrowed from automotive where instead of having electronics scattered all over the vehicle, you consolidate compute and power distribution into zones. For a bike, it means no cassette nor derailleur, no seat stay, no motor bolted to a frame that was designed before anyone knew a motor was going in. Everything crucial lives in this central hub. It's utilitarian in a way that saves cost and simplifies assembly, and honestly? I came around on it. There's something refreshingly honest about a design that says, ""Here's where all the important stuff is, and we're not going to hide it."" Form following function in a way that feels considered, not lazy.

That utilitarian, function-first philosophy extends way beyond the physical design—it's baked into the software stack too, and the first place you notice that is the display. They call it the ""Portal,"" which is a bit dramatic, but whatever. It's a bright, high-contrast LCD mounted in the center of the handlebars that's easily visible even in direct sunlight. But the screen itself isn't the interesting part—it's what's running underneath: a real-time OS built from scratch, close to the metal, which means it's responsive and powerful in a way that e-bike displays just aren't. During the demo, I pulled the battery out to examine it—turn the handle, pull straight out, and you've got a 500 or 800 watt-hour pack depending on trim level. It's got 240-watt USB-C PD 3.1 bidirectional ports that can charge the battery itself or power anything else you plug into it, plus a little e-ink display shows state of charge. Anyways, when I slammed it back in, the display fired up instantly. No boot logo. No loading screen. Just on. Chris, the CEO, lit up when I pointed this out—apparently I was the first person in their demo cycle to notice. But it's a small example of what can be done when you have full control of everything: from pedal cadence, to assist curves, to brake feel. It also means they can push over-the-air updates to continuously improve the bike rather than leave it frozen in time. More importantly, the connectivity enables smartphone integration at a level that simply doesn't exist in the e-bike world—the kind of seamless experience you'd only find in the best electric cars.

It utilizes your phone as a key. Walk up to the bike, it wakes up, knows its you, and loads your settings. You hop on and go. Walk away, it locks. The motor physically immobilizes the rear wheel, the pedals decouple, the battery latches electronically. Motion sensors send you a push notification if someone tampers with it and a very loud alarm sounds to deter theft. If someone does actually manage to steal it, you can track it via GPS and remotely disable the entire bike. And while there’s also the potential for ALSO to use this for evil, every component is also serialized and bound to your bike unless you unbind it, eliminating the resale value for stolen parts.

This set of features addresses the worst part of bike ownership in the US: where do I park this thing and will it still be there when I get back? This eliminates the need for bike racks. No carrying a u-lock. Just park it and walk away. Like a vehicle. It’s frictionless.

Beyond security, there’s turn-by-turn navigation designed for cycling that actually accounts for your assist level, average speed, state of charge, and elevation. So you get accurate ETAs and arrival state of charge—critical if you’re using this as…. a vehicle. There’s media integration too. Whatever’s playing on your phone shows up on the display, you can control volume and seeking with the handlebar buttons. Incoming calls also pop up on the display asking if you want to accept or decline. These aren’t bike features. They’re vehicle features. And that distinction is what ALSO is betting on—that people (especially here in the US) will stop thinking: “I’m going to go for a bike ride” and start thinking: “I’m going to take my ALSO to get groceries at the farmers market.” Which we did, by the way, without having to park a car 5 blocks away—we just rode our vehicles straight through. It’s a paradigm shift, and I started to “get it.”

ALSO claims this multi-use functionality is enabled by their modular frame system. The pitch is simple: instead of buying multiple bikes for different purposes, you buy one TM-B and swap the top frame depending on what you're doing. There's a ""Solo"" frame for recreation, a ""Utility"" frame with a rear rack for hauling cargo or kids, and a ""Comfort"" frame with an upright seating position for people who don't identify as cyclists. You go into the settings menu, hit ""swap frame,"" wait a couple seconds for the electric latch to release, lift off the old frame, pop on the new one, and it auto-detects everything—powering the integrated lights and adjusting the vehicle's ride settings based on expected load.

It's cool! Genuinely cool! And I can kinda see one legitimate use case: having two utility racks—one set up with a toddler seat for taking my kid to school, another configured with bins for grocery runs. But beyond that? I'm skeptical. How often is someone actually going to swap these? Does the rear rack suddenly become a burden when I want to ride up the canyon? I doubt it. I mean, it's an 80-pound e-bike. Really, the modularity aspect is most useful when multiple people in the home want to ride the same bike. You each have your own seat with your preferences paired to it and it's an easy swap. But that's also only necessary because there's no quick seat-post adjustment like most bikes have. You need to use an allen key. Now, ALSO wisely decided that most third-party bike accessories were already great and they didn't need to make many proprietary ones—though they will be selling a phone holster and bins that are the exact same size as a paper grocery bag, which is clever. Being compatible with stuff that already exists is great! But it also means accepting different mounting systems that are typically rather permanent once installed. Even ALSO's own custom front rack isn't that easily removable—you pressure clamp it onto the fork upper and it stays there. It feels like they started with this ambitious modular concept and then kind of gave up after the seat. Which, fine. Maybe modularity for modularity's sake isn't the point. But it does make me wonder if the complexity and cost of the electric latch system and serialized frames is justified when, in practice, most people will probably install one configuration and leave it there forever.

That said, despite being and looking the way that it does, the bike handles shockingly well. It's agile at low speeds and easy to maneuver in tight spaces (not typical of 80 pound e-bikes), but it's also stable at high speeds. I hit 31 miles per hour multiple times and it never felt twitchy or nervous. Part of that is geometry. They tuned head tube angle and trail to balance maneuverability with stability. Part of that is weight distribution. That magnesium heart puts the battery and motor low and central. More so than any e-bike on the market. But it's mostly suspension. Both the front and rear have a shocking amount of travel and the inverted front fork has enough adjustability that you can dial in a comfortable setup to absorb road bumps without it feeling sloppy or tighten it up when you need more feedback. Chris actually told me to intentionally hit a pothole to test it. So I did. And then a manhole cover. The bike soaked up both impacts without complaint—no harsh jarring, no loss of control—but it never felt slow or unresponsive either. Given that the retail price of this almost certainly white-labeled FOX fork is $2 grand alone, perhaps I should be unsurprised it was so good.

But the real party trick is the propulsion system they call Dream Ride. This bike is completely pedal-by-wire—the first of its kind. There's no mechanical connection between the pedals and the rear wheel. You pedal into a generator that converts your input to electrical energy, which the bike either sends to the motor or, if you’re generating more than it needs to output, into the battery. And that motor? It’s massive. ALSO built it in-house using a bar-wound stator—and extremely high-end technique you’d mostly only see in the best electric cars. Which, given where this comes from, makes sense. But it’s overkill for a bike in the best possible way. It’s also the first e-bike with real regenerative braking. While you can coast like a normal bike, as soon as you start to pull the brakes, energy is captured by your deceleration, run through inverters, and put back into the battery. And just like in a Rivian, the regen is *really* good. The bike can regen all the way down to a complete stop, and unless you’re biting into the handbrakes with a really aggressive braking event, you don’t use the friction brakes at all—which explains why the disk brakes appear to be a little undersized—because you basically never use them.

Upfront, you’ll also see something quite unusual: while most e-bikes have a wheel speed sensor that measures how often the front wheel finishes a complete rotation, the ALSO has a grid-type speed sensor that measures more than 60 times per revolution—more than any other bike on the market. The rear doesn’t even have one of these sensors—also unheard of—but that’s because it uses the much more accurate real-time input/output at the drive motor—which is possible because the belt is always spinning, which is possible because the pedals aren’t connected to the drivetrain at all. Not only does this allow them to implement a pseudo regen-controlled ABS system, but it also makes for the smoothest accelerating, gentlest braking, and most responsive e-bike I’ve ever used. It’s like the first time I drove an EV. Incredibly smooth, but also weird.

And this bike feels *weird*.

Because in the default automatic mode, there is no gearing because the bike literally doesn’t have gears. It's like an electric car. Now, there are “assist levels”—standard e-bike vernacular—but they're not really ""assisting"" you. Because you cannot move this bike without the bike moving itself. Remember, there is no physical connection to the rear wheel! At assist level one, the lowest setting, you top out at about 10 to 11 miles per hour. At assist level ten, you max out at the Class 3 speed limit of 28 mph. Maybe 30 if you're going downhill before the limiter kicks in. But here's the bizarre part: no matter what assist level you're in, the pedaling resistance feels the same. It's one long, predictable, consistent ""gear."" You go up a hill and there's zero resistance increase on the pedals. You go downhill and you pedal at the same speed with the same resistance. It's truly bizarre. Not in a bad way, but absolutely an adjustment. It feels like a vehicle, not like a bicycle.

Now, if you don't want that, there's a manual mode on all but the base-trim with 10 fixed ratios that you can shift through with the same handlebar buttons. Start peddling from a stop in 8th gear and there’s a ton of resistance—just like there would be in a high gear on a real bike—but it’s an artificial sensation created by resistance from the pedal stator. The best way to explain it is to just show you: \[see attached video\]

So yeah, the torque is absurd. It’s rated at 180 Newton-meters at the wheel—more than double what most e-bikes push. In max assist mode, if you stomp the pedals from a stop, the front wheel actually lifts. It’s like: “Oh, you want to go?” Chris told me one of their core safety goals was for the bike to out-accelerate a car at an intersection—specifically hitting 0.3 Gs, which is right at the line between normal and aggressive driving. And yeah, they nailed it. I took this thing up a legitimately steep Palo Alto hill—the kind where you’d normally downshift on a regular bike and resign yourself to a slow grind. While the motor was audibly working, hard, the bike held its maximum speed the entire way up. No slowdown. Just relentless forward motion. And the thing genuinely keeps up with traffic, which is kind of the point if you’re trying to use it for real transportation. The idea is that by accelerating like a vehicle—rather than like a bike—you’re less likely to get cut off or misjudged by drivers who expect cyclists to be slow and in the way. But there’s a trade-off: the more the bike behaves like a motorcycle, the more rider skill matters, and the more serious things get if something goes wrong. Speed can help you escape danger—but it can also amplify it.

Now, about regulations: the TM-B cleverly meets multiple e-bike classifications depending on mode. In off-road mode, it's limited to 20 mph and the throttle is disabled, making it a Class 1 bike—though there's a clever workaround where you can press the throttle while pedaling to get a slight boost because it creates artificial “half-gears.” In road mode, the throttle works up to 20 mph (Class 2) but pedal assist takes you to 28 mph (Class 3). It’s truly a class e-bike of all time.

Obviously, the more aggressively you ride, the more power you consume. And if you misjudge range, you're walking home or calling an Uber because remember, you cannot pedal unassisted—the pedals are just a video game controller. While the bike's 500 or 800 watt-hour battery seems to be on the small side, much of that energy is recaptured through regeneration. ALSO claims you'll get anywhere from 60 to 100 miles based on battery size and how you ride, which should cover most use cases.

Riding this bike was an absolute blast—the most fun I've had on any e-bike ever. But at the end of my two-hour ride, I was left with an uncomfortable question: who is this for?

You see, there will be three trims. A limited Launch Edition and a Performance trim—with the same capabilities, both at $4,500. Then, a base model will follow with the smaller battery, cheaper fork, automatic-only modes, and a price in the $3,000s. But even at those prices, the TM-B sits in no-man's-land. It's way more expensive than cheap Chinese e-bikes that still get you from A to B. But it's also not specialized enough to win over serious mountain bikers dropping $8,000+ on their rigs. Those buyers want proven trail capability, and the TM-B—despite its all-terrain package—isn't that bike. This is a high-performance urban vehicle that *can handle* gravel.

ALSO is betting there's a market in between. People who want quality transportation and will pay for features that genuinely make it better than a car for short trips. People who care about integrated software and phone-as-a-key. People in cities where parking is impossible and traffic is miserable. Maybe that market exists in San Francisco, Portland, Amsterdam, or Paris. In most of America? I'm less convinced.

But ALSO's real play seems to be commercial. They showed a number of four-wheeled cargo quad prototypes to replace golf carts and smaller vans for last-mile delivery, which are becoming increasingly desired in cities like New York, where they're permitted in bike lanes. And that's where all this vertical integration pays off. When you've already built all the hardware and own the software, adapting it to new form factors is trivial. Especially in a largely unregulated market such as this one—no crash or safety tests and years long certifications required. That's where they might actually have something.

The TM-B is unlike anything else out there. It made me rethink what a bicycle is and should be used for. So who's it for? Definitely not everybody. But it's for me. I've wanted to ride it again every single day since that demo, so I put down a deposit—not for the Launch Edition because I'm not into that colorway, but I'm getting one. Whether ALSO succeeds or fades into obscurity doesn't really matter. Someone needed to take this swing, and I'm glad it's them.

​I'm at the point where I have been ""de-smarting"" my house. 

As it stands currently I have:

Ubiquiti cameras.  

Ecobee thermostat.   

Nest protect smoke detectors (they all have expiry dates of 28/29 so will be replacing them in a few years).   

Google home minis throughout the house (really don't use these at all other than playing music occasionally in rooms without a sound system).    

Nest home security (which only works locally... Because... Well Google).

Shitty ADT home security which Google sent me for free which I need to replace.

Various HUE bulbs.   



​My core frustration is that ""smart"" devices just mean ""connected to an app,"" not that they're actually smart enough to interface and cross-operate with each other. This seems to defeat the entire purpose.

​My perfect example is the Google/Nest ecosystem I'm was in: 

​My Nest Protect has motion sensors. Does it report this motion to my Nest Thermostat for occupancy? No.

​My Nest Protect has a speaker. Did Nest Home Security (when it existed) use it to broadcast alarms? No.

​My Google Home Minis are speakers. Did Nest Security use them to broadcast alarms? Also no.

​It's maddening. These devices have all the hardware, but they live in their own little silos, even within the same brand.

So.. my wife wants a keypad door lock for the front door, so I'm tempted to get Igbee or z-wave and then go into the home assistant rabbit hole.

But then I find myself wondering, why? Do I want to even attempt this? 

The older I get the more I find myself wanting to de-smarten my house. 

What on earth can I do with a door lock connected to the internet other than check it's locked? 

I think after 10 years of smart home companies being uber-shit - I think I'm just burnt out. 

As it stands currently, I have a schedule set on my 'smart thermostat' and have the autoaway features disabled, because they are shit. 

I could have a dumb thermostat and probably only feature I'd miss was checking my AC wasn't broken when I wasn't at home at getting an alert my humidity or temp was too high. 

I check my cameras occasionally if there's motion on my driveway. That's about it.

I guess the only smart device I truly appreciate is the smoke detectors that would alert my phone in the event of a fire.

Long time lurker. Was interested in your opinions - I have a moderate amount of home automation but I feel like the more I add the more difficult my life gets. Fundamentally I think when I automate something I'm swapping regular predictable workload for sporadic unpredictable downtime/troubleshooting. 

  
Simple example - my robot mop takes out the 5-10 minutes a day of mopping and vacuuming the floor. But it sometimes gets stuck, or needs detangling, or requires fresh water/emptying the mop, filter cleans etc. 

Almost certainly in terms of total time saved it's better but the unpredictable nature of it can make things quite stressful. 

I have tado controlling heating but there's always batteries to replace. The one in my bedroom seems to be causing a sporadic water hammer effect which happens randomly in the nights so I've had to take that off but have no time to troubleshoot. I used to control through google but they recently updated their setup so it needs setting up again so no voice control. I have a samsung smart watch to make things easier to control. I try to send a message on my smart watch but Whatsapp now needs reauthenticating with a code. I have a sofabaton universal remote but it's barely functional. I could go on.. 

I was just wondering if anyone else had similar issues or fundamental changes of approrach to address this?",homeautomation,Realistic-Fly-7289,6,0.64,23,2025-10-26 18:13:45,https://www.reddit.com/r/homeautomation/comments/1ogjoo8/does_my_smart_home_actually_make_my_life_easier/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""smart home""'"

Reddit,1oh2v52,Setting Up Smart Home Using Ubiquiti Gear and Home Assistant.,https://i.redd.it/mzl97i0byjxf1.jpeg,"Good evening Ubiquiti Novices and Fellow addicts - I built a house that was meant to be a 100% smart home. During the build process I fell sick and could not be present during the formative construction days. Fast forward I fired the Sub Contractor that I had and took over the project personally, thank god for that. I am about to complete the house but the only things that were wired as per the image I have posted is-

Cables in Wall Mounted Box:

1). Ethernet cables that wire each bedroom, living room, office, the pool pump and all cameras. No ethernet was installed for door bell and 3 Tablets that are meant to control the Home Assistant throughout the house.

2). Coaxial cables also going to each bedroom, living room, etc, and

3). 10 Speaker cables which are hanging on the left of the image.

I have never done this before but have embraced it and will set this up myself of which I have started. And in that spirit I have now figured out where each cable goes.

PURCHASED EQUIPMENT-

I just purchased which I have not received yet.

1). Dream Machine Pro Max and - 2) Switch Pro Max 24 PoE.  But after reading a few comments on Reddit I am feeling some consternation at my current choice of equipment. The Comments say the Dream Machine SE (Special Edition) is actually better than the Dream Machine Pro Max.

2). Switch Pro Max 24 which I have also read various other negative comments of and based on those comments I am writing this post seeking help.

3). Ubiquiti UACC Rack Panel Patch Blank-24

4). Tripp Lite SMART1500LCD 1500VA Rack Mount UPS Battery Backup, 900W, 8 Outlets, PWM Sine Wave, Short Depth 2U Rackmount UPS, AVR, LCD Screen

5). Tripp Lite Metered PDU, 15A, 13 Outlets (5-15R), 120V, 5-15P, 100-127V Input, 15 ft. Cord, 1U Rack-Mount Power,  (PDUMH15)

6). NavePoint 12U Server Rack Enclosure with Glass Door, Cooling Fan, Locks, & Removable Side Panels - 12U Wall Mount Network Cabinet 19 Inch Rack 17.7"" Deep (450mm), but after receiving it I discovered that it is not deep enough to hold the equipment I just purchased.

7). 2 x NavePoint Cantilever Server Vented Shelves Rack Mount 19 Inch 1U Black 14 Inches (350mm) deep. Chose this to hide equipment from room occupant, would it be ok to position the wall mounted bracket higher closer to the ceiling rather than the 4 feet it is currently positioned on?

CONNECTING TO HOME ASSISTANT-

All of this will connect to Home Assistant through a

1). Reolink 12MP 8CH PoE Security Camera System with IK10 Vandalproof, 4pcs Dome PoE Cams Outdoor, Spotlights Color Night Vision, Built-in 2TB HDD, Smart AI Detection, Two-Way Talk, RLK8-1200V4 - I added three more cameras to the four this unit came with.

2). Home Assistant Green | Smart Home hub with Advanced Automation | Official Home Assistant Hardware

The ethernet cables in the image also represent cables that are wired directly to 3 TP-Link EAP610, Omaha Business WiFi 6 AX1800 Wireless Gigabit Access Points spread across the house to maximize wifi range.

ADVICE-

Based on my current cable configuration and requirements for this smart home, what equipment would the novices on this subreddit advise me to get and how would you plan on placing the equipment?

I also would like to remotely control the fireplace which was wired for regular power and not with ethernet cables. The fireplace is unique and is in the center of the room and now not possible to run ethernet to it.

The current cables were set in one of the walk in closets in one of the bedrooms, not my choice. My question is should I be concerned about heat produced by equipment causing a fire over time since there shall be clothes in that room? This was the impetus to get a rack with a fan.

Should I be planning to host this equipment in another location? What is the best option for the Rack if I wanted the equipment hidden as it would look undesirable having cables and equipment in a clothing closet.

I am going to call Ubiquity tomorrow morning to cancel my current purchase as my order has not been processed yet.

I anxiously anticipate any and all advice and I am happy to have joined the Ubiquity family.",Ubiquiti,DonXendon,19,0.93,19,2025-10-27 07:49:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/1oh2v52/setting_up_smart_home_using_ubiquiti_gear_and/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""smart home""'"

Secondly I am really interested in getting a smart lock. Apple Homey Key looks good and i look the idea of not having to carry keys on me the whole time. Does anyone recommend any smart locks out there that don't have a keypad as I hate the looks of those with a passion. The Nuki pro /ultra locks look ideal but they don't have Home Key so I think I'll pass on those.

Me and my friends are planning to start a small business around smart home automation here in Tamil Nadu, and I wanted to get some honest feedback on whether this idea can actually work locally.

Our idea is simple:
We want to make controlling devices in your home smart, simple, and affordable — especially for middle-class and small home owners.

We’re starting small with a prototype for a single room, where an ESP32 microcontroller and relay module will control a light and a TV.
You can use your mobile app or website to turn them ON/OFF remotely, and see the current status (like whether your light is ON or OFF).

From there, we plan to expand and control more devices — lights, fans, AC, curtains, door locks, etc.
Later, we’ll add features like:

Voice control (Google Assistant or offline options)

Energy monitoring

Scheduling (like turning off AC at 6AM automatically)

Remote access and security features


Our goal is to create an affordable, reliable, and customizable home automation system that works even without internet, and can later scale up to full-house or commercial setups.

So my question is:
👉 Do you think something like this would work well in Tamil Nadu?
👉 Are people actually interested in affordable smart home setups right now, or is the market still too small?",TamilNadu,Undo_Light,6,0.88,9,2025-10-24 17:44:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/TamilNadu/comments/1oew3zs/hey_guys_me_and_my_friends_are_planning_to_start/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""smart home""'"

Reddit,1odqxon,Amazon unveils Smart Glasses for delivery drivers!,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1odqxon,"**Amazon’s delivery glasses: The newest innovation designed to enhance the delivery experience**

*AI-powered sensing capabilities and computer vision technology display real-time navigation and delivery instructions so drivers can rely less on their phones and more on their surroundings.*

# Key takeaways

* Amazon is developing smart delivery glasses to help Delivery Associates (DAs) identify hazards, seamlessly navigate to customer’s doorsteps, and improve customer deliveries.
* The wearable system was designed and optimized with input from hundreds of DAs, drivers who work for Delivery Service Partners (DSPs).
* The devices implement advanced computer vision processing and AI integration for seamless driver experiences.

Every day, DAs connect millions of customers with their packages, navigating neighborhoods with precision and care. Our goal is to continually explore new and [innovative ways](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/operations/amazon-ai-innovations-delivery-forecasting-robotics) that can make their experience as safe and seamless as possible.

Since we launched the [Delivery Service Partner program](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/policy-news-views/amazon-dsp-program-update) in 2018, we’ve used technology to support the DA experience, whether that’s in [dedicated simulation training](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-safety-training-delivery-driver) to prepare them for real-world delivery experiences, investments in package handling processes, or improved navigation. We’ve built an entire system of technology to support drivers throughout the end-to-end delivery journey.

Now, Amazon is adding to that system by introducing smart delivery glasses—wearable technology that makes the DA experience even safer and more seamless. Designed specifically for DAs, these glasses help them scan packages, follow turn-by-turn walking directions, and capture proof of delivery—all without the use of their phone. The glasses create a hands-free experience, reducing the need to look between the phone, the package, and the surrounding area.

**Technology at work: AI and machine learning make deliveries safer and more intuitive**

Amazon’s smart glasses leverage [AI-powered](https://www.aboutamazon.com/artificial-intelligence-ai-news) sensing capabilities and computer vision, along with cameras to create a heads-up display that includes everything from navigation details to hazards to delivery tasks. When drivers safely park at a delivery location, the glasses automatically activate and the DA is given their delivery information—right in their field of view—starting with locating the right packages inside their vehicles to the corresponding homes.

The display then offers walking turn-by-turn navigation to the delivery address, using Amazon’s geospatial technology to guide drivers to the exact delivery location without having to check their phone. If there are hazards, or a need to navigate complex environments like apartment buildings, the glasses will guide DAs safely to their destination.

**Technology for comfort: Physical materials and driver feedback create glasses for all-day use**

Throughout the development process, we turned to the experts—drivers themselves—to get it right. Hundreds of DAs tested early versions of the glasses and provided crucial feedback. Their insights shaped everything from the glasses’ comfort for all day use to the clarity of the displays.

“I felt safer the whole time because the glasses have the info right in my field of view,” explains Kaleb M., a DA working for Maddox Logistics Corporation in Omaha, Nebraska, who tested the technology. “Instead of having to look down at a phone, you can keep your eyes forward and look past the display—you’re always focused on what’s ahead.[](https://www.aboutamazon.com/news/transportation/amazon-delivery-service-partner-investment-safety-ai-tools)The glasses feature a small controller worn in the delivery vest that contains operational controls, a swappable battery ensuring all-day use, and a dedicated emergency button to reach emergency services along their routes if needed. The glasses also support prescription lenses along with transitional lenses that automatically adjust to light.”

**Technology for the future: Building a full delivery system**

As we continue refining the technology, we’re leveraging the latest advancements in AI to create an end-to-end system where technology supports an even safer and more seamless delivery experience along every step of their journey—from inside our delivery stations, to over the road, to the last hundred yards to a customer’s doorstep.

We anticipate future versions of the glasses will provide real-time defect detection, where the glasses can help notify drivers if they’ve mistakenly dropped a package at a customer doorstep that does not correspond with the house or apartment number on the package, detect hazards like low light and adjust the lenses, notify that there’s a pet in the yard, and more.

The smart glasses are just one step in our broader effort to innovate in the last-mile delivery process—creating solutions that improve safety and the overall work experience for the DAs who bring smiles to customers’ doors every day.",augmentedreality,AR_MR_XR,30,0.82,3,2025-10-23 07:20:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/augmentedreality/comments/1odqxon/amazon_unveils_smart_glasses_for_delivery_drivers/,False,False,False,,"search_term:'""wearable technology""'"

I actually came across Buyhatke through Dhruv Rathee video, and it’s been a game-changer since. Like this Noise Twist smartwatch — listed for ₹4,999 MRP, but available for just ₹1,099 when I compared prices. The same tool has helped me save hundreds before (even spotted my Sony CH720N headphones cheaper on AJIO than Myntra).
